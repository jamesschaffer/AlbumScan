## UX PRINCIPLES

### Core Design Philosophy

**Speed Over Perfection:**
- Get users scanning quickly with minimal friction
- Optimize for fast feedback (identification in 2-4 seconds for 80-90% of albums)
- Progressive disclosure of results (show what's ready immediately)
- 80-90% success rate prioritized over 100% accuracy

**Simple Over Complex:**
- Binary outcomes: success or try again (no complex error recovery flows)
- No photo review/retake step (immediate processing after capture)
- No inline retry buttons (close and rescan to retry)
- Minimal user decisions required

**Honest Feedback:**
- Clear loading states with personality ("Flipping through every record bin in existence...")
- Transparent about what's happening (three distinct loading messages)
- Non-blocking errors (show partial results when possible)
- Auto-dismissing error banner (3 seconds, then ready to retry)

**Music-Focused Context:**
- Reviews emphasize musical merit, NOT financial value
- Brand personality: knowledgeable music snob (friendly but opinionated)
- Cultural significance over market considerations
- Honest assessments (explicitly calls out mediocre albums)

## BRAND & VISUAL IDENTITY

### Brand Colors

**Primary Brand Color (Green):**
- **Value:** RGB(0, 221, 81) or `Color(red: 0, green: 0.87, blue: 0.32)`
- **Hex:** #00DD51
- **Usage:**
  - SCAN button background
  - History button border
  - Camera button border
  - Dynamic text highlights (album names, artist names in loading states)
  - Rating numbers in recommendation badge
  - Framing guide border
- **Personality:** Fresh, energetic, optimistic (music discovery excitement)

**Supporting Colors:**
- **Black:** Primary background for camera, loading, and history screens
- **White:** Primary text color on black backgrounds
- **Gray (placeholder):** `Color.gray.opacity(0.3)` for missing artwork
- **Red (error):** Error banner background
- **Orange (warning):** Review failure icon color

### Typography

**Primary Font:** Helvetica Neue (iOS system font family)
- **Artist Name:** 26pt bold
- **Album Title:** 22pt bold
- **Body Text:** 18pt regular
- **Metadata Labels:** 18pt bold (with light gray values)

**Accent Font:** Bungee (custom font, brand-specific)
- **Usage:** Rating numbers in recommendation badge only
- **Size:** 20pt
- **Color:** Brand green

**Brand Personality in Text:**
- Loading messages use witty, self-aware humor
- Review disclaimer: "These ratings are generated fresh each time and may vary wildly, much like asking three different music snobs about the same albumâ€”it's all vibes, baby."
- Error messages are clear and helpful (no corporate jargon)

### Visual Hierarchy

**Information Priority:**
1. Album artwork (largest, full-width)
2. Recommendation badge (overlaid on artwork bottom)
3. Artist name + album title (prominent below artwork)
4. Metadata (released, genre, label - structured row format)
5. Cultural context summary (2-3 sentences)
6. Evidence bullets (3-5 specific claims)
7. Rating (embedded in body text)
8. Key tracks (3-7 tracks with ðŸŽµ emoji header)

---

## UI/UX IMPLEMENTATION

### Design System

**iOS Native Patterns:**
- Follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines
- Use native SwiftUI components throughout
- Standard iOS navigation (X button for dismiss, swipe gestures)
- Sheet presentation for history view
- No custom navigation bars (use standard iOS patterns)

**SF Symbols (Apple's Icon Library):**
- **Gear icon** (gear.fill) - Settings button on camera view
- **Hamburger icon** (three horizontal lines) - History button on camera view
- **X mark** - Close button on album details
- **Camera fill** - Camera button on history view
- **Clock** - Empty state icon in history
- **Exclamation triangle** - Review failure warning icon
- **Checkmark circle** (checkmark.circle.fill) - Ultra benefits bullets in Settings

**Dark Mode:**
- Primarily black background aesthetic (camera, loading, history)
- Album details uses white background for readability
- SwiftUI handles automatic adaptation
- Test both light and dark system modes
- Brand green works well in both modes

**Dynamic Type:**
- Support accessibility text sizing
- Text scales with iOS system settings
- Maintain readability at all sizes (test at largest setting)
- Minimum 18pt body text in album details

**Haptic Feedback:**
- **Status:** Not currently implemented
- **Future Enhancement:** Could add subtle haptics on button taps, successful scan, errors

### Performance Targets

**App Launch:**
- **Target:** < 2 seconds from icon tap to Camera View ready
- **Actual:** 1.5 second branded launch screen + fade
- Camera feed activates immediately after launch (no black screen)
- Logo displayed throughout experience (maintains brand presence)

**Identification Response:**
- **Without Search (80-90% of scans):**
  - ID Call 1: 2-4 seconds target
  - Artwork: 1-2 seconds (runs concurrently with final ID processing)
  - Total: 3-6 seconds to Loading Screen 2 ("We found...")
- **With Search (10-20% of scans):**
  - ID Call 1 + Call 2: 5-9 seconds combined
  - Artwork: 1-2 seconds
  - Total: 6-11 seconds to Loading Screen 2

**Review Generation Response:**
- **Cached (70-80% after initial usage):** Instant display from CoreData ($0 cost)
- **Uncached:** 3-5 seconds from start of Loading Screen 3
- **User Perception:** 2.5-second confirmation hold on "We found..." gives breathing room before review loads

**Total Scan Time (End-to-End):**
- **Best Case (no search, cached review):** 5-7 seconds
- **Common Case (no search, new review):** 8-13 seconds
- **Deep Cut (with search, new review):** 11-18 seconds
- **User Experience:** Progressive disclosure makes wait feel shorter (seeing artwork at 3-6 seconds)

**Screen Transitions:**
- **Target:** 60fps smooth animations
- Loading state transitions use slide-in/slide-out animations (0.3-0.4s duration)
- Error banner uses spring animation (response: 0.4, dampingFraction: 0.8)
- No janky transitions between screens

**History Scrolling:**
- Smooth scrolling even with 100+ albums
- Thumbnail images (200Ã—200) cached for performance
- CoreData lazy loading for large lists
- NSCache holds 20-30 recent images in memory

**Offline Access:**
- History loads instantly from CoreData (no loading spinner)
- Cached albums display full details immediately (artwork + review)
- New scans require internet connection (no offline degradation)

### Accessibility

**VoiceOver:**
- **Status:** Partially implemented (native SwiftUI provides basic support)
- All interactive elements should have descriptive labels
- Album artwork should announce as "Album cover for [Artist] - [Album Title]"
- Placeholder artwork announces as "Album art unavailable"
- Logical navigation order (top to bottom, left to right)
- Loading states announce progress changes

**Dynamic Type:**
- Text scales with iOS system settings
- Minimum 18pt body text in album details
- Metadata labels use 18pt font
- Test at largest accessibility sizes (ensure no text truncation)
- Album artwork scales with content but maintains aspect ratio

**Color Contrast:**
- **Primary Screens (Black background):**
  - White text on black: High contrast ratio (meets WCAG AAA)
  - Brand green (#00DD51) on black: Sufficient contrast for UI elements
- **Album Details (White background):**
  - Black text on white: High contrast
  - Metadata uses lighter gray for visual hierarchy (meets WCAG AA)
- Test in both light and dark system modes

**Tap Targets:**
- **Minimum:** 44Ã—44pt for all interactive elements (Apple HIG standard)
- **SCAN button:** Large circular button (80+pt diameter), easy to tap while holding phone
- **History button:** 64Ã—64pt with padding
- **Camera button:** 64Ã—64pt with padding
- **Close button (X):** 64Ã—64pt with padding
- **Swipe-to-delete:** Full row height for gesture recognition
- Generous spacing between tappable elements (prevents accidental taps)

---

## ERROR HANDLING

### UX Principles for Errors

**Non-Blocking Philosophy:**
- Show partial results whenever possible (artwork + metadata even if review fails)
- Artwork failures never prevent album information display (use gray placeholder)
- Only block user for fatal errors (identification completely failed)

**Clear Feedback:**
- Error banner (not full-screen interruption) for identification failures
- Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds (user ready to retry immediately)
- Inline error messages for review failures (orange warning icon + explanation)
- No complex error recovery flows (keep it simple)

**No Retry Buttons:**
- User retries by rescanning (close details â†’ scan again)
- Simpler UX than inline retry buttons
- Matches natural user behavior ("let me try taking a better photo")

---

### Error Scenarios & UX Responses

**1. Identification Failure (ID Call 1 or 2 Fails)**

**Causes:**
- Network timeout
- Invalid/unparseable response from OpenAI
- Rate limit hit (unlikely)
- Server error (5xx)
- Album genuinely not identifiable from photo
- Search gate blocks Call 2 (< 3 readable characters OR low text confidence)

**User Experience:**
- **Visual:** Red banner slides down from top of screen (over camera view)
- **Message:** "Unable to identify this cover art"
- **Animation:** Spring animation (response: 0.4, dampingFraction: 0.8)
- **Duration:** 3 seconds (auto-dismiss)
- **Behavior:** Camera resets to idle after dismiss (ready for next scan)
- **No user action required** - banner disappears automatically

**Cost Impact:**
- ID Call 1 only: ~$0.01
- ID Call 1 + Call 2: ~$0.04-0.05
- Review generation never triggered

**Common Causes Users Can Fix:**
- Not an album cover (random object, book, poster)
- Back cover instead of front cover
- Too blurry/out of focus
- Too far away (album too small in frame)
- Multiple albums in frame (use framing guide)
- Partial album showing (use framing guide)
- Poor lighting (too dark)

---

**2. Review Generation Failure**

**Causes:**
- Network timeout during review API call
- Invalid response from OpenAI
- Server error (5xx)
- Rate limit hit (unlikely)

**User Experience:**
- **Shows:** Album Details Screen with partial information
- **Displays:**
  - Album artwork (or gray placeholder if artwork also failed)
  - Artist name + album title
  - Metadata (release year, genres, label)
  - Orange warning triangle icon
  - Heading: "Review Temporarily Unavailable" (bold, prominent)
  - Explanation: "The detailed review couldn't be generated for this album. The album was successfully identified, but our review service encountered an issue."
  - Suggestion: "ðŸ’¡ Tip: Scan this album again to retry generating the review."
- **NO retry button** - user must close details and rescan

**Cost Impact:**
- Identification cost already paid (~$0.01-0.05)
- Review generation cost NOT incurred ($0)
- User can retry by rescanning (will trigger full identification + review flow again)

**Philosophy:** Partial success is better than total failure - user still learned what album it is

---

**3. Album Artwork Retrieval Failures**

**Causes:**
- MusicBrainz search returns no results
- Cover Art Archive returns 404 (common for obscure releases)
- Network timeout during artwork download
- Downloaded image corrupted/invalid

**User Experience:**
- **Visual:** Gray rectangle placeholder
- **Text:** "Album art unavailable" (centered, system font, 17pt medium)
- **Behavior:** Non-blocking - continues to Loading Screen 2 â†’ Loading Screen 3 â†’ Album Details
- **Review displays normally** with placeholder artwork

**Cost Impact:** $0 (free APIs, failures are non-blocking)

**Important:** All artwork failures are non-blocking - album information ALWAYS displays

---

**4. No Internet Connection**

**Detection:**
- URLSession automatically detects network unavailability
- Error occurs during first API call (identification)

**User Experience:**
- **Same as identification failure** - error banner appears
- **Message:** "Unable to identify this cover art"
- **User Action:** Check internet connection, retry scan

**Behavior:**
- New scans require internet (no offline mode for scanning)
- History works offline (cached albums display normally)

---

**5. Camera Permission Denied**

**Causes:**
- User denied camera access on first launch
- User revoked permission in iOS Settings

**User Experience:**
- **Shows:** Permission Error Screen (full-screen, blocks app usage)
- **Icon:** Camera with badge exclamationmark (orange, 70pt)
- **Heading:** "Camera Access Required" (title2, bold)
- **Explanation:** "AlbumScan needs access to your camera to identify album covers." (body, secondary color, centered)
- **Action:** "Open Settings" button (blue, rounded, full width)
- **Button Behavior:** Opens iOS Settings â†’ AlbumScan â†’ Enable Camera permission

**User Recovery:**
1. Tap "Open Settings"
2. Enable Camera permission in iOS Settings
3. Return to app (automatically detects permission change)
4. App shows Camera View (ready to scan)

---

**6. Camera Hardware Failure**

**Causes:**
- Device has no camera (rare, iOS requirement)
- Camera hardware malfunction
- iOS camera service unavailable

**User Experience:**
- **Alert:** "Camera unavailable. Please restart the app."
- **Button:** "OK" (dismisses alert)
- **Behavior:** Graceful degradation (app doesn't crash)

**Recovery:** User restarts app

---

**7. Storage/CoreData Failures**

**Disk Full:**
- **Cause:** Device storage completely full (rare)
- **User Experience:** Alert: "Unable to save album. Storage may be full."
- **Behavior:** Scan completes successfully (user sees results), just not saved to history
- **Action:** "OK" dismisses alert

**CoreData Save Failure:**
- **Cause:** Database corruption or write failure
- **User Experience:** Alert: "An error occurred saving this album."
- **Behavior:** Scan completes, results displayed, not saved to history
- **Action:** "OK" dismisses alert
- **Logging:** Error logged for debugging

**Note:** Storage errors are unlikely (album metadata is small: ~5KB text + ~500KB artwork)

## DESIGN PATTERNS

### Progressive Disclosure

**Philosophy:** Show users what's ready immediately, build anticipation for what's coming

**Implementation:**
1. **Loading Screen 1** (Identifying): Witty message with animated ellipsis
   - Builds anticipation
   - Personality shines through ("Flipping through every record bin in existence...")
2. **Loading Screen 2** (Identified): Shows artwork + "We found [Album] by [Artist]"
   - 2.5-second confirmation hold
   - User can visually verify correct match
   - Album/artist names in brand green (visual hierarchy)
   - Gives breathing room before next step
3. **Loading Screen 3** (Loading Review): Another witty message
   - "Writing a review that's somehow both pretentious and correct..."
   - Maintains engagement during wait
4. **Album Details**: Full information display
   - All content loads at once (no progressive rendering)

**Benefit:** 8-13 second total wait feels shorter because user sees progress at 3-6 seconds

---

### Loading State Messages

**Design Principle:** Witty, self-aware, personality-driven

**Current Messages:**
- **State 1 (Identifying):** "Flipping through every record bin in existence..."
- **State 2 (Identified):** "We found [Album Title] by [Artist Name]"
- **State 3 (Loading Review):** "Writing a review that's somehow both pretentious and correct..."

**Animation:**
- Ellipsis dots cycle 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 every 0.5 seconds
- Gives impression of ongoing work
- Dynamic text (album/artist names) in brand green

**Tone:** Knowledgeable music snob (friendly but opinionated)
- Self-aware about being pretentious
- Humor keeps users engaged during wait
- No corporate jargon or generic "Loading..."

---

### Error Banner Pattern

**Design Principle:** Non-blocking, auto-recovering, minimal user burden

**Visual Design:**
- **Color:** Red background (error state)
- **Position:** Slides down from top of screen
- **Z-index:** Overlays camera view (doesn't navigate away)
- **Text:** White, semi-bold, 16pt, centered
- **Message:** "Unable to identify this cover art" (clear, non-technical)
- **Animation:** Spring (response: 0.4, dampingFraction: 0.8) for natural feel

**Behavior:**
- Appears: Slides down with spring animation (~0.3s)
- Hold: 3 seconds visible
- Dismisses: Fades out automatically
- Recovery: Camera resets to idle (ready for next scan)

**Why This Pattern:**
- Non-blocking (doesn't interrupt flow with modal alert)
- Auto-recovering (no button tap required)
- Fast retry (user immediately ready to scan again)
- Matches natural behavior (user will retry with better photo)

---

### Placeholder Artwork Design

**Visual Specifications:**
- **Background Color:** `Color.gray.opacity(0.3)` (neutral, works in light and dark mode)
- **Text:** "Album art unavailable" (centered)
- **Font:** System font, 17pt, medium weight, secondary color
- **Aspect Ratio:** 1:1 square (matches album covers)
- **Border:** None (simple rectangle)
- **No icon** - keep it minimal

**Implementation:**
- SwiftUI Rectangle with overlay text
- Reused throughout app (Loading Screen 2, Album Details, History)
- Maintains visual consistency
- VoiceOver announces as "Album art unavailable"

**Usage Context:**
- MusicBrainz returns no results
- Cover Art Archive returns 404
- Network timeout during download
- Downloaded image corrupted/invalid

**Philosophy:** Placeholder is non-intrusive, doesn't draw attention to failure

---

### Button Styles

**Primary Action (SCAN button):**
- **Size:** Large circular (80+pt diameter)
- **Color:** Brand green background, white icon
- **Position:** Bottom center of camera view
- **Feedback:** No haptics currently (future enhancement)
- **Visual:** Prominent, can't miss it

**Secondary Actions (Settings, History, Camera, Close buttons):**
- **Size:** 64Ã—64pt circular
- **Style:** Black semi-transparent background (0.6 opacity)
- **Border:** 4px brand green stroke
- **Icon:** White, 20pt bold
- **Position:** Floating over content (bottom-left for Settings, bottom-right for History/Camera, top-right for Close)

**Consistency:** All circular buttons use same styling pattern (green border, black background)

---

### Swipe Gestures

**Swipe-to-Delete (History):**
- **Trigger:** Swipe left on album row
- **Partial Swipe:** Shows red trash icon (indicates action available)
- **Full Swipe:** Immediately deletes (no confirmation required)
- **Feedback:** Standard iOS deletion animation
- **Undo:** Not available (user can rescan if needed)

**Why This Pattern:**
- Standard iOS behavior (users expect it)
- Fast cleanup of duplicate scans
- No confirmation modal (keeps flow simple)

---

### Recommendation Badge Overlay

**Design:**
- **Position:** Bottom of album artwork (full width)
- **Background:** Black semi-transparent (0.8 opacity)
- **Layout:** Two-column
  - Left: Recommendation label (white, uppercase, bold)
  - Right: Rating (brand green, Bungee font, 20pt)
- **Padding:** 12pt vertical, 16pt horizontal

**Labels (8-tier system):**
- TIER 1: "ESSENTIAL CLASSIC", "GENRE LANDMARK", "CULTURAL MONUMENT"
- TIER 2: "INDIE MASTERPIECE", "CULT ESSENTIAL", "CRITICS' CHOICE"
- (See 03_core_features.md for complete tier system)

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Label draws attention first (white on black, high contrast)
- Rating reinforces recommendation (green = positive association)
- Overlaid on artwork (doesn't take separate space)

---

### Empty States

**History Empty State:**
- **Icon:** Clock (system SF Symbol, gray, 60pt)
- **Message:** "Scan your first album to begin" (gray, centered)
- **Background:** Black (consistent with app theme)
- **Action:** Implicit (user knows to go scan)

**Philosophy:** Simple, clear, not patronizing

---

### Sheet Presentation (Settings Screen)

**Design Principle:** Fixed-height sheet for focused settings configuration without full navigation

**Visual Design:**
- **Presentation:** Fixed height sheet at 460pt (SwiftUI `.presentationDetents([.height(460)])`)
- **Background:** Black (matches app branding)
- **Dismissal:** Swipe-down gesture or tap outside sheet (no X button required)

**AlbumScan Ultra Benefits Card:**
- **Container:**
  - White semi-transparent background (`Color.white.opacity(0.1)`)
  - 16pt corner radius
  - 24pt internal padding
  - 20pt horizontal and vertical margins
- **Typography:**
  - Title: "AlbumScan Ultra" (28pt bold, white)
  - Price: "$11.99/year" (20pt semibold, brand green)
  - Benefit bullets: 18pt regular, white text
- **Benefits List:**
  - Four bullets with green checkmark icons (checkmark.circle.fill)
  - Each benefit on separate line with icon + text layout:
    1. "Advanced search for obscure albums"
    2. "Enhanced accuracy for modern releases (2020+)"
    3. "Detailed reviews with cited sources"
    4. "Support continued development"

**Toggle Control:**
- **Label:** "Enable Advanced Search" (18pt regular, white)
- **Style:** Standard iOS Toggle with green tint when ON
- **State Persistence:** UserDefaults with key `"searchEnabled"`
- **Visual Feedback:** Immediate toggle response (no loading spinner)

**User Experience:**
- Single-purpose sheet (settings configuration only)
- No nested navigation or complex flows
- Changes take effect immediately (no "Save" button required)
- Dismisses smoothly with iOS standard sheet animation

**Why This Pattern:**
- Non-intrusive (doesn't navigate away from camera)
- Fixed height prevents over-scrolling or awkward sizing
- Standard iOS sheet behavior (users expect swipe-to-dismiss)
- Focus on single toggle keeps UX simple
