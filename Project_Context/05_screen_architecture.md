## Verification Summary

**Document Accuracy:** This document has been verified against the actual codebase implementation as of October 29, 2025.

**Files Verified:**
- `CameraView.swift` (Screen 1 - camera interface, history button, error banner, framing guide)
- `CameraManager.swift` (cropping logic, framing guide positioning, identification flow, timing)
- `LoadingView.swift` (Loading Screens 1-3 - messages, animations, transitions)
- `AlbumDetailsView.swift` (Album Details Screen - layout, typography, close button, failure states)
- `ScanHistoryView.swift` (Scan History Screen - list implementation, camera button)
- `WelcomeView.swift` (Welcome Screen - first launch)
- `PermissionErrorView.swift` (Permission Error Screen - denial handling)
- `ContentView.swift` (app routing logic)
- `ScanErrorView.swift` (confirmed exists but NOT used)

**Major Corrections Made:**
1. **Architecture Update:** Changed from "Phase 1A/1B/2/3" to "Two-Tier Identification System (ID Call 1, ID Call 2, Review Generation)"
2. **Screen 1 Camera View:**
   - Corrected history icon: hamburger (three lines), not clock symbol
   - Added vertical positioning detail: 1.5% downward adjustment
   - Confirmed cropping to guide boundaries
3. **Loading Screen 1:**
   - Updated to two-tier identification architecture with conditional search
   - Added search gate validation details
   - Corrected timing: 5-7 seconds without search, 8-13 with search
   - Changed error navigation: Error banner (not full-screen error view)
4. **Loading Screen 2:**
   - Corrected hold time: 2.5 seconds total (not 2 seconds)
   - Added logo and layout details
5. **Loading Screen 3:**
   - Removed "minimum display time" claim (not enforced in code)
   - Added cache behavior details
   - Removed retry button mention
6. **Album Details Screen:**
   - Fixed recommendation system: 8-tier contextual labels (NOT 4 emoji categories)
   - Corrected close button position: bottom right (not top right)
   - Removed non-existent history icon
   - Removed all "Retry Review" button mentions
   - Added specific typography details (font sizes, Helvetica Neue, Bungee for ratings)
7. **Scan History Screen:**
   - Changed "SCAN button" to "Camera icon button"
   - Removed non-existent history icon
   - Added swipe-to-delete behavior details
8. **Error Handling:**
   - Replaced "Scan Error Screen" with "Error Banner (Identification Failure)"
   - Documented actual implementation: top slide-down banner with auto-dismiss
   - Added note that ScanErrorView.swift exists but is not used

**Evidence-Based Changes:**
- Framing guide: 20px margins, 4px green border, vertical adjustment of 1.5%
- Cropping: Confirmed via `cropToGuide()` function in CameraManager.swift:312
- History button: Three horizontal rectangles (lines 90-98 in CameraView.swift)
- Loading Screen 2 hold: 2.5 seconds (line 750 in CameraManager.swift)
- Error banner: Spring animation, 3-second auto-dismiss, red background
- Album details close button: Bottom right with green border (line 300 in AlbumDetailsView.swift)
- Recommendation system: 8 tiers defined in album_review.txt prompt

**Architecture Verified:**
- Two-tier identification: ID Call 1 (gpt-4o, no search) â†’ ID Call 2 conditional (gpt-4o-search-preview, with search)
- Review generation: gpt-4o (no search capability) with cache check
- State machine: `.idle â†’ .identifying â†’ .identified â†’ .loadingReview â†’ .complete` (ScanState.swift)
- Error states: `.identificationFailed` triggers banner, `.reviewFailed` shows partial results
