# CORE FEATURES

### Feature 1: Camera-Based Album Identification
- **Priority:** MUST-HAVE (Core feature)
- **Description:** Users can take a photo of any album cover, and the app identifies it using AI vision through a two-tier identification system
- **User Story:** "As a record store browser, I want to take a photo of an album cover so that I can instantly know what album it is and who the artist is"
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Camera View shows live camera feed immediately upon load with square framing guide
  - User taps "SCAN" button to capture photo (no review/retake - immediate processing)
  - Photo is processed via two-tier identification system:
    - **ID Call 1:** Single-prompt identification (2-4 seconds, ~80-90% success rate)
    - **ID Call 2:** Search finalization with search gate (3-5 seconds, conditional - only 10-20% of scans)
    - **Artwork Retrieval:** MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive (1-2 seconds, runs after identification)
    - **Review Generation:** Album review with caching (3-5 seconds or instant if cached)
  - App displays "We found [Album] by [Artist]" with artwork after identification completes (2 second confirmation screen)
  - If identification fails (either Call 1 unresolved or Call 2 fails search gate), displays error banner at top: "Unable to identify this cover art"
  - Error banner auto-dismisses after 3 seconds and returns to idle camera
  - Review generation runs after confirmation screen
  - If review generation fails, shows album details with "Review Temporarily Unavailable" message
  - Works with various cover conditions (worn, angled, partially visible, minimal text)
  - Stores MusicBrainz artwork, NOT user's original photo
  - Search gate blocks wasteful searches: requires 3+ readable characters AND medium/high text confidence

#### Sub-Feature 1A: High-Resolution Album Artwork Retrieval
- **Priority:** MUST-HAVE (Required for Feature 3 display)
- **Description:** After identification, retrieve high-resolution album artwork from MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive
- **Technical Approach:** Sequential API calls using artist + album metadata from identification
- **User Story:** "As a user, I want to see high-quality album artwork so that I can visually identify and appreciate the album"
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - After identification returns album metadata, immediately initiate MusicBrainz artwork search
  - Search MusicBrainz API using artist name and album title to find release MBID (MusicBrainz ID)
  - Use MBID to query Cover Art Archive API for album artwork
  - Retrieve highest quality artwork available (prefer "front" cover image, typically 500px)
  - If Cover Art Archive returns no results, use gray placeholder with "Album art unavailable" text
  - Cache retrieved artwork locally (both 200px thumbnail for history and high-res for detail view)
  - Total artwork retrieval completes within 1-2 seconds
  - Handle multiple release variants by selecting the first matching result
  - Artwork URLs stored in Album entity (CoreData) for reference
  - If MusicBrainz search returns no matches, display album details with placeholder artwork
  - Artwork retrieval failure NEVER blocks album information display

##### Timing & Flow

**Current Implementation:**
- ID Call 1: 2-4 seconds (80-90% success, no search)
- ID Call 2: 3-5 seconds (10-20% of scans, conditional search)
- Artwork Retrieval: 1-2 seconds (runs after identification succeeds)
- Confirmation Screen: 2 seconds (shows "We found..." with artwork)
- Review Generation: 3-5 seconds or instant if cached
- **Total Time:** 8-13 seconds for new album with search, 5-7 seconds without search

**Sequential Execution:**
1. ID Call 1 executes (identifying state)
2. If searchNeeded: ID Call 2 executes with search gate validation
3. After identification succeeds: Artwork fetch begins
4. Transition to identified state (2-second confirmation with artwork)
5. Transition to loadingReview state
6. Review generation executes (with cache check first)
7. Save to CoreData and display full album details

**Non-Blocking Behavior:**
- If artwork retrieval fails: show placeholder, continue to confirmation screen
- If review generation fails: show album details with error message and rescan suggestion
- Partial success always better than total failure

**Loading States (from ScanState enum):**
- `.identifying` - "Flipping through every record bin in existence..."
- `.identified` - Shows artwork + "We found [Album] by [Artist]" (2 seconds)
- `.loadingReview` - Shows artwork + "Writing a review that's somehow both pretentious and correct..."
- `.complete` - Transitions to AlbumDetailsView
- `.identificationFailed` - Shows error banner "Unable to identify this cover art"


### Feature 2: Cultural Context & Quality Assessment
- **Priority:** MUST-HAVE (Core differentiator)
- **Description:** AI-powered concise album review providing critical assessment, cultural significance, and buying recommendation - explicitly NOT financial value or pricing information
- **User Story:** "As a record store browser, I want a quick, honest assessment of why an album matters musically and whether I should buy it, so I can make informed decisions while flipping through bins"
- **Architecture:** Generated after successful identification and artwork retrieval, uses `gpt-4o` (NO web search capability)
- **Input:** Receives clean metadata from identification (artist name, album title, release year, genres, record label)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Review prompt receives ONLY metadata (no album identification task)
  - Displays 2-3 sentence opening summary capturing the album's core essence and importance
  - Provides 3-5 bullet points (formatted as actual bullets â€¢) with specific evidence:
    - Critical reception (specific scores when confident, qualitative descriptions otherwise)
    - Concrete impact examples (chart performance, sales figures, awards when known)
    - Specific standout tracks and sonic qualities
    - Genre innovation or influence on other artists
    - Reputation evolution (initially panned vs. later acclaimed, etc.)
  - Includes rating out of 10 (assessment based on analysis)
  - Provides clear recommendation using tiered contextual labels (examples):
    - **TIER 1:** Essential Classic, Genre Landmark, Cultural Monument
    - **TIER 2:** Indie Masterpiece, Cult Essential, Critics' Choice
    - **TIER 3:** Crowd Favorite, Radio Gold, Crossover Success
    - **TIER 4:** Deep Cut, Surprise Excellence, Scene Favorite
    - **TIER 5:** Time Capsule, Influential Curio, Pioneering Effort
    - **TIER 6:** Reliable Listen, Fan Essential, Genre Staple
    - **TIER 7:** Ambitious Failure, Divisive Work, Uneven Effort
    - **TIER 8:** Forgettable Entry, Career Low, Avoid Entirely
  - Uses honest, direct language - calls out mediocre or bad albums explicitly
  - Focuses on what actually matters about the album (no filler or generic praise)
  - Evaluates albums purely on musical merit - artist's personal controversies or social issues may be mentioned for context but do NOT devalue their musical contributions or impact
  - Explicitly avoids any language about "investment," "value," "rare," "pressing details," or "collectibility"
  - NEVER mentions price, monetary value, or market considerations
  - Model: `gpt-4o` (regular model, NO search capability - music history is stable)
  - Shows cached content if album has been scanned before (avoids redundant API calls)
  - Cache check happens BEFORE API call (CoreData lookup with title normalization)
  - Title normalization strips variants: Deluxe, Remaster, Reissue, Edition, Anniversary
  - If review generation fails, displays album details with "Review Temporarily Unavailable" + suggestion to rescan

### Feature 3: Album Information Display

    - If review generation failed: Show artwork + basic metadata + error message
      - Error message: "Review Temporarily Unavailable" with explanation
      - Suggestion: "ðŸ’¡ Tip: Scan this album again to retry generating the review."
