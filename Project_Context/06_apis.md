## TWO-TIER IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM

### Overview
AlbumScan uses a **conditional two-tier identification architecture with OpenAI** that optimizes for speed, accuracy, and cost by avoiding expensive web search calls for 80-90% of albums.

**Key Design Principle:** Most albums can be identified using the LLM's internal knowledge alone. Web search is only triggered when necessary, drastically reducing costs while maintaining high accuracy.

**Key Benefits:**
1. **Fast Identification:** 80-90% of albums identified in 2-4 seconds without search (ID Call 1 only)
2. **Cost Optimization:** Most scans cost $0.01 (Call 1) vs. $0.03-0.04 (Call 1 + Call 2 with search)
3. **Search Gate Validation:** Prevents wasteful API calls on poor-quality captures (requires 3+ readable characters AND medium/high confidence)
4. **User Confirmation:** 2.5-second hold shows matched album before review generation
5. **Progressive Disclosure:** Users see results incrementally (identifying → identified → loading review → complete)
6. **Better Error Handling:** Can show partial results if review fails (artwork + metadata only)
7. **Aggressive Caching:** Review cache with title normalization eliminates redundant costs (instant display, $0.00)
8. **Non-Blocking Failures:** Artwork retrieval failures don't block album information display

### ID Call 1: Single-Prompt Identification (2-4 seconds)

**Purpose:** Identify album using internal knowledge (NO web search) - handles 80-90% of albums

**API Call Details:**
- **Provider:** OpenAI API
- **Model:** `gpt-4o` (vision + text, NO web search capability)
- **Input:** Album cover photo (JPEG, 1024×1024, ~1-2MB)
- **Prompt:** `single_prompt_identification.txt`
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - Single-pass identification with conditional search request
  - Extracts visible text from cover
  - Describes artwork visually
  - Attempts recognition using internal training data
  - Returns THREE possible outcomes:
    - **HIGH confidence:** Album identified definitively → Skip Call 2
    - **MEDIUM confidence:** Album identified with reasonable certainty → Skip Call 2
    - **LOW confidence (search needed):** Cannot identify confidently → Trigger Call 2
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - **Time:** 2-4 seconds
  - **Cost:** ~$0.01 per call
  - **Success Rate:** 80-90% of albums identified without search
  - **Usage:** Every scan (100%)
- **Max Tokens:** 500

**Success Response JSON (HIGH/MEDIUM confidence):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "artistName": "Radiohead",
  "albumTitle": "OK Computer",
  "releaseYear": 1997,
  "genres": ["Alternative Rock", "Art Rock"],
  "recordLabel": "Parlophone",
  "searchNeeded": false,
  "confidence": "high"
}
```

**Search Request Response JSON (LOW confidence):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "searchNeeded": true,
  "observation": {
    "extractedText": "TVOTR, Seeds",
    "albumDescription": "Bold red background with white geometric typography",
    "textConfidence": "medium"
  },
  "suggestedQuery": "TVOTR Seeds album"
}
```

**On Success (HIGH/MEDIUM confidence):**
- Skip ID Call 2 entirely (no search needed)
- Proceed directly to artwork retrieval
- Total identification time: 2-4 seconds
- Total identification cost: ~$0.01

**On Search Needed (LOW confidence):**
- Validate search worthiness via **search gate**:
  - Count meaningful characters in `extractedText` (exclude spaces, punctuation)
  - Check `textConfidence` level
  - **Gate Requirements:** 3+ meaningful chars AND "medium" or "high" confidence
- **If gate passes:** Proceed to ID Call 2 with search
- **If gate fails:** Show error banner ("Unable to identify - insufficient text")
  - Total cost of blocked search: ~$0.01
  - User can retry immediately (camera resets to idle)

---

### ID Call 2: Web Search Finalization (3-5 seconds) - CONDITIONAL

**Purpose:** Use web search to identify obscure/deep-cut albums that Call 1 couldn't recognize (10-20% of scans)

**Trigger:** Only when ID Call 1 returns `searchNeeded: true` AND search gate validation passes

**API Call Details:**
- **Provider:** OpenAI API
- **Model:** `gpt-4o-search-preview` (WITH web search capability)
- **Input:** Text extraction and description from Call 1 (NO image)
- **Prompt:** `search_finalization.txt`
- **Template Variables:**
  - `{extractedText}` - Text visible on album cover
  - `{albumDescription}` - Visual description of cover
  - `{textConfidence}` - Confidence level ("high", "medium", "low")
  - `{searchQuery}` - Optimized search query from Call 1
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - Performs ONE web search using suggested query from Call 1
  - Cross-references search results with visual description
  - Focuses on deep cuts, obscure albums, minimal text covers
  - Returns final identification or unresolved error
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - **Time:** 3-5 seconds
  - **Cost:** ~$0.03-0.04 per call
  - **Usage:** 10-20% of scans (only when Call 1 requests search)
  - **Trigger Rate:** Low (most albums identified without search)
- **Max Tokens:** 500

**Success Response JSON:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "artistName": "TV on the Radio",
  "albumTitle": "Seeds",
  "releaseYear": 2014,
  "genres": ["Indie Rock", "Art Rock"],
  "recordLabel": "Harvest Records"
}
```

**Error Response JSON:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "reason": "Could not find album matching the provided metadata and visual description"
}
```

**On Success:**
- Proceed to artwork retrieval
- Total identification time: 5-9 seconds (Call 1 + Call 2)
- Total identification cost: ~$0.01 + ~$0.03-0.04 = ~$0.04-0.05

**On Failure:**
- Show error banner ("Unable to identify this cover art")
- Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds, reset camera to idle
- Total cost of failed identification: ~$0.04-0.05
- User can retry immediately

---

### Album Artwork Retrieval (1-2 seconds)

**Purpose:** Fetch high-resolution album artwork using metadata from ID Call 1 or 2

**Trigger:** Runs immediately AFTER successful identification (Call 1 or Call 2 completes)

**Sequence:**
1. **MusicBrainz Search** (0.5-1 second)
   - Query using artist + album from identification metadata
   - Retrieve MBID (MusicBrainz ID)
   - Endpoint: `https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release`
   - Query: `artist:{artistName} AND release:{albumTitle}`
   - User-Agent header REQUIRED: `AlbumScan/1.0 (james@jamesschaffer.com)`

2. **Cover Art Archive** (0.5-1 second)
   - Query using MBID from MusicBrainz
   - Download 500px image (large size)
   - Endpoint: `https://coverartarchive.org/release/{mbid}`

3. **Cache & Display** (minimal, concurrent)
   - Generate 200px thumbnail for history
   - Cache both sizes locally (CoreData)
   - Display in Loading Screen 2 ("We found...") and Album Details Screen

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Total Time:** 1-2 seconds
- **Cost:** $0 (free open APIs)
- **Non-Blocking:** Failures don't prevent album information display

**Artwork Failure Handling:**
- MusicBrainz returns no results → Use gray placeholder, continue to Loading Screen 2
- Cover Art Archive returns 404 → Use gray placeholder, continue to Loading Screen 2
- Network timeout → Use gray placeholder, continue to Loading Screen 2
- All artwork failures are non-blocking (album metadata + review still display normally)

**On Success:**
- Transition to Loading Screen 2 (2.5-second confirmation hold)
- Display artwork + "We found {Album Title} by {Artist Name}"
- After 2.5 seconds → Transition to Loading Screen 3 (review generation begins)

**On Failure:**
- Still transition to Loading Screen 2 with gray placeholder artwork
- Continue normal flow (review generation runs after 2.5-second hold)
- Placeholder text: "Album art unavailable"

---

### Review Generation (3-5 seconds or instant if cached)

**Purpose:** Generate comprehensive cultural context and buying recommendation (NOT financial value)

**Trigger:** Runs AFTER Loading Screen 2 (2.5-second confirmation hold completes)

**API Call Details:**
- **Provider:** OpenAI API
- **Model:** `gpt-4o` (regular model, NO web search capability)
  - **Critical:** Uses non-search model because music history is stable and well-established
  - **October 2025 Change:** Switched from `gpt-4o-search-preview` → `gpt-4o` to eliminate hidden server-side search costs ($0.15/review)
- **Input:** Clean metadata from identification (text string: "Artist: {artistName}, Album: {albumTitle}, Year: {releaseYear}, Genre: {genres}, Label: {recordLabel}")
- **Prompt:** `album_review.txt`
- **Template Variables:**
  - `{artistName}` - Artist name from identification
  - `{albumTitle}` - Album title from identification
  - `{releaseYear}` - Release year from identification
  - `{genres}` - Comma-separated genre list
  - `{recordLabel}` - Record label from identification
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - NO web search (music knowledge is stable, search not needed)
  - NO image input (uses metadata only)
  - NO identification task (already complete)
  - Generates ratings, recommendations (8-tier labels), key tracks, bullets
  - Focuses on musical merit - NOT financial value, pricing, or collectibility
  - **Aggressive caching** with title normalization
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - **Time:** 3-5 seconds for new review, OR instant if cached
  - **Cost:** ~$0.05-0.10 per new review, $0.00 if cached
  - **Cache Hit Rate:** 70-80% after initial usage
- **Max Tokens:** 1500

**Cache Strategy (Critical Cost Optimization):**
1. **Before API call:** Query CoreData for existing album with matching artist + album
2. **Title Normalization:** Strip variant suffixes (Deluxe, Remaster, Reissue, Edition, Anniversary)
   - Example: "Dark Side of the Moon (2011 Remaster)" → "Dark Side of the Moon"
3. **If cached:** Skip API call entirely, return cached review instantly ($0 cost)
4. **If not cached:** Generate new review, cache result indefinitely
5. **Failure Caching:** Cache failure state for 30 days (prevents retry loops)

**Success Response JSON:**
```json
{
  "contextSummary": "OK Computer is Radiohead's landmark 1997 album that captured millennial anxiety through experimental rock. It transformed alternative music by proving ambitious art-rock could achieve both critical and commercial success. The album's influence on indie and electronic music remains profound nearly three decades later.",
  "contextBullets": [
    "Acclaimed as one of the greatest albums ever made, with a 9.1 from Pitchfork and consistent top-10 rankings in all-time lists.",

  ],
  "rating": 9.5,
  "recommendation": "Essential Classic",
  "keyTracks": ["Paranoid Android", "Karma Police", "No Surprises", "Exit Music (For a Film)", "Let Down"]
}
```

**Recommendation System:** 8-tier contextual labels (NOT emojis):
- **TIER 1:** Essential Classic, Genre Landmark, Cultural Monument
- **TIER 2:** Indie Masterpiece, Cult Essential, Critics' Choice
- **TIER 3:** Crowd Favorite, Radio Gold, Crossover Success
- **TIER 4:** Deep Cut, Surprise Excellence, Scene Favorite
- **TIER 5:** Time Capsule, Influential Curio, Pioneering Effort
- **TIER 6:** Reliable Listen, Fan Essential, Genre Staple
- **TIER 7:** Ambitious Failure, Divisive Work, Uneven Effort
- **TIER 8:** Forgettable Entry, Career Low, Avoid Entirely

**On Success:**
- Display full review in Album Details Screen
- Save complete album data to CoreData (metadata + artwork + review)
- Cache review indefinitely for future scans (music history doesn't change)

**On Failure:**
- Still display Album Details Screen with:
  - Album artwork (already fetched, or placeholder if failed)
  - Basic metadata (artist, album, year, genres, label)
  - Error message: "Review Temporarily Unavailable" with explanation
  - Suggestion: "💡 Tip: Scan this album again to retry generating the review."
  - **NO retry button** - user must close details and rescan to retry
- Partial success better than total failure

### State Management Requirements

**SwiftUI State Enum (ScanState.swift):**
```swift
enum ScanState {
    case idle                    // Camera view, ready to scan
    case identifying             // ID Call 1 (and possibly Call 2) + artwork retrieval in progress
    case identified              // Identification + artwork complete, brief transition (2.5s hold)
    case loadingReview           // Review generation in progress (with cache check)
    case complete                // All processing done, displaying Album Details
    case identificationFailed    // ID Call 1/2 failed or search gate blocked
    case reviewFailed            // Identification worked, review generation failed
}
```

**State Flow:**
```
.idle
  → .identifying (ID Call 1 starts)
  → .identified (ID complete, 2.5s hold with "We found..." message)
  → .loadingReview (review generation starts)
  → .complete (navigate to Album Details)

Alternative failure paths:
  .identifying → .identificationFailed (show error banner, reset to .idle)
  .loadingReview → .reviewFailed (partial success, still show album details)
```

**Identification Response Structures:**
```swift
// ID Call 1/2 Success Response
struct Phase1Response {
    var success: Bool
    var artistName: String
    var albumTitle: String
    var releaseYear: Int?
    var genres: [String]
    var recordLabel: String?
    var searchNeeded: Bool           // Only relevant for Call 1
    var confidence: String?          // "high", "medium", or "low"
}

// ID Call 1 Search Request (when searchNeeded = true)
struct SearchRequest {
    var searchNeeded: Bool
    var observation: SearchObservation
    var suggestedQuery: String
}

struct SearchObservation {
    var extractedText: String
    var albumDescription: String
    var textConfidence: String       // "high", "medium", or "low"
}
```

**Album CoreData Entity (see DATA MODEL section below for full schema)**

### Error Handling in Two-Tier System

**Scenario 1: ID Call 1 Fails (Unresolved)**
- User Experience: Error banner slides down from top - "Unable to identify this cover art"
- Duration: Auto-dismisses after 3 seconds, resets camera to idle
- User Action: Can retry immediately (no button needed)
- Cost Impact: ~$0.01 (ID Call 1 only, no Call 2 triggered)
- System Behavior: Review generation never triggered

**Scenario 2: Search Gate Blocks ID Call 2**
- Trigger: ID Call 1 returns "search needed" but extracted text < 3 chars OR confidence is "low"
- User Experience: Same error banner - "Unable to identify this cover art"
- Reasoning: Prevents wasteful search on poor-quality captures (blurry, too far, non-album objects)
- Cost Impact: ~$0.01 (ID Call 1 only, Call 2 blocked before execution)
- System Behavior: Save money by not running expensive search with poor input

**Scenario 3: ID Call 2 Fails (Search Returns No Match)**
- User Experience: Error banner - "Unable to identify this cover art"
- Cost Impact: ~$0.01 (Call 1) + ~$0.03-0.04 (Call 2) = ~$0.04-0.05 total
- System Behavior: Review generation never triggered

**Scenario 4: Identification Succeeds, Review Generation Fails**
- User Experience: Album Details Screen with:
  - Album artwork (or gray placeholder if artwork failed)
  - Basic metadata (artist, title, year, genres, label)
  - Orange warning triangle icon
  - Error message: "Review Temporarily Unavailable"
  - Suggestion: "💡 Tip: Scan this album again to retry generating the review."
  - **NO retry button** - user must close and rescan
- Cost Impact: ~$0.01-0.05 (identification) + $0 (review blocked)
- System Behavior: Partial success is better than total failure

**Scenario 5: Artwork Retrieval Fails, Everything Else Succeeds**
- User Experience: Album Details Screen with:
  - Gray placeholder with text "Album art unavailable"
  - Full review content
  - All metadata visible
- Non-blocking error: Review displays normally
- Cost Impact: Full cost (~$0.06-0.15 depending on search usage)
- System Behavior: Artwork is nice-to-have, not essential

**Scenario 6: Network Failure Mid-Process**
- During identification: Show error banner, reset to idle
- During review generation: Show partial results (artwork + metadata) with error message
- Network recovery: User can retry by rescanning (no inline retry button)

---

### Caching Strategy for Two-Tier System

**Identification Cache (ID Call 1/2):**
- **Decision:** Do NOT cache identification results by image
- **Reasoning:**
  - Image hashing is expensive and complex
  - Identification is fast (2-4s for Call 1) and cheap (~$0.01)
  - User rarely scans exact same photo twice
  - Not worth the implementation complexity

**Review Cache (Critical Cost Optimization):**
- **Cache Key:** Normalized artist + album title (lowercase, strip spaces/punctuation)
- **Title Normalization:** Strip variant suffixes before cache lookup:
  - Remove: "Deluxe", "Remaster", "Remastered", "Reissue", "Edition", "Anniversary", "Expanded"
  - Example: "Dark Side of the Moon (2011 Remaster)" → "Dark Side of the Moon"
  - Benefit: Match different editions of same album to cached review
- **Cache Location:** CoreData (part of Album entity)
- **Cache Duration:** Indefinite (music history doesn't change)
- **Cache Check:** BEFORE review API call:
  - Query CoreData for existing album with matching artist + normalized title
  - If exists with `phase2Completed = true` → Skip API call, use cached review instantly ($0 cost)
  - If exists with `phase2Failed = true` and < 30 days old → Skip retry (prevent loop)
  - If not exists → Make API call, cache result in CoreData
- **Cache Savings:** Massive cost reduction for duplicate album scans
  - First scan: ~$0.05-0.10 (generates review)
  - Subsequent scans: $0.00 (uses cache)
  - Cache hit rate: 70-80% after initial usage

**Artwork Cache:**
- **Cache Key:** MBID (MusicBrainz ID) or `"{artist}_{album}"` fallback
- **Cache Location:** CoreData as Data blobs (both 500px and 200px versions)
- **Cache Duration:** Never expires (artwork doesn't change)
- **Cache Check:** Before MusicBrainz call:
  - If album exists in CoreData with artwork → Use cached artwork, skip API calls
  - If not exists → Fetch from MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive, cache in CoreData

**Memory Cache (NSCache):**
- Hold 20-30 most recently viewed artworks in memory
- Speeds up history scrolling
- Auto-clears on memory pressure

### API Implementation Notes

**Phase 1 API Call (Swift):**
```swift
let phase1Response = await claudeAPI.identifyAlbum(
    image: capturedPhoto,
    prompt: phase1IdentificationPrompt,
    enableWebSearch: false,  // CRITICAL: disable for speed
    maxTokens: 300,
    temperature: 0.0  // Deterministic for identification
)
```

**Phase 2 API Call (Swift):**
```swift
// Check cache first
if let cachedAlbum = await coreDataManager.fetchAlbum(
    artist: artistName, 
    title: albumTitle
) {
    // Use cached review, skip API call
    return cachedAlbum
}

// No cache, make API call
let phase2Response = await claudeAPI.generateReview(
    metadata: "Artist: \(artist), Album: \(album), Year: \(year), Genre: \(genres.joined(separator: ", ")), Label: \(label)",
    prompt: phase2ReviewPrompt,
    enableWebSearch: true,  // Enable research
    maxTokens: 1500,
    temperature: 0.3  // Slightly creative for review
)
```

**Parallel Execution Pattern:**
```swift
async let artworkTask = fetchArtwork(artist: artistName, album: albumTitle)
async let reviewTask = generateReview(artist: artistName, album: albumTitle)

let (artwork, review) = await (artworkTask, reviewTask)
```

- Array of images with URLs, types, and thumbnail variants
- Each image has:
  - `types`: ["Front", "Back", etc.]
  - `front`: boolean
  - `image`: Full resolution URL
  - `thumbnails`: Object with `small` (250px) and `large` (500px) URLs

**Image Sizes Available:**
- `small`: 250px
- `large`: 500px  
- `original`: Full resolution (often 1000-1500px)

**Download Strategy:** 
- Download `large` (500px) for detail view
- Generate thumbnail (200x200) from large image for history list
- Store both in CoreData as Data blobs

**404 Handling:** 
- Common for obscure releases
- Gracefully fall back to placeholder: "Album art unavailable"
- Non-blocking error (album info still displays)

**Example Request:**
```
GET https://coverartarchive.org/release/67a63246-0de4-4cd8-8ce2-35f0e17f652b
```

**Example Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "types": ["Front"],
      "front": true,
      "image": "https://coverartarchive.org/release/.../front.jpg",
      "thumbnails": {
        "small": "https://...-250.jpg",
        "large": "https://...-500.jpg"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Response Time:** 0.5-1 second (query) + 0.5-1 second (download)

- **TIER 1 (Undeniable Greatness):** Essential Classic, Genre Landmark, Cultural Monument
- **TIER 2 (Critical Darlings):** Indie Masterpiece, Cult Essential, Critics' Choice
- **TIER 3 (Crowd Pleasers):** Crowd Favorite, Radio Gold, Crossover Success
- **TIER 4 (Hidden Gems):** Deep Cut, Surprise Excellence, Scene Favorite
- **TIER 5 (Historical Interest):** Time Capsule, Influential Curio, Pioneering Effort
- **TIER 6 (Solid Work):** Reliable Listen, Fan Essential, Genre Staple
- **TIER 7 (Problematic):** Ambitious Failure, Divisive Work, Uneven Effort
- **TIER 8 (Pass):** Forgettable Entry, Career Low, Avoid Entirely

**Display:** LLM chooses ONE label per album, displayed in album details badge overlay with rating

## DATA MODEL

### CoreData Schema

#### Album Entity

```swift
Album {
  // Primary Key
  id: UUID (primary key)
  
  // Phase 1A Data (Vision Extraction) - Not stored, only used for Phase 1B
  // extractedText and albumDescription are temporary, not persisted
  
  // Phase 1B Data (Identification Metadata)
  artistName: String
  albumTitle: String
  releaseYear: String?
  genres: [String]  // Array stored as JSON or comma-separated
  recordLabel: String?
  phase1BCompleted: Bool  // Track if identification succeeded
  
  // Phase 2 Data (Artwork)
  musicbrainzID: String?  // MBID for future reference
  albumArtURL: String?  // Cover Art Archive URL (large/500px)
  albumArtThumbnailData: Data?  // Cached 200x200 JPEG for history
  albumArtHighResData: Data?  // Cached 500px JPEG for detail view
  albumArtRetrievalFailed: Bool  // Track if artwork lookup failed
  phase2Completed: Bool  // Track if artwork fetch completed
  
  // Phase 3 Data (Review)
  contextSummary: String?  // 2-3 sentence opening
  contextBulletPoints: [String]  // 3-5 bullets, stored as JSON or comma-separated
  rating: Double?  // 0-10
  recommendation: String?  // ESSENTIAL/RECOMMENDED/SKIP/AVOID
  keyTracks: [String]  // Stored as JSON or comma-separated
  phase3Completed: Bool  // Track if Phase 3 succeeded
  phase3Failed: Bool  // Track if Phase 3 needs retry
  phase3LastAttempt: Date?  // When we last tried Phase 3 (for retry logic)
  
  // Metadata
  scannedDate: Date  // When user first scanned this
  lastViewedDate: Date?  // Last time user opened this album in history
  
  // Raw API Responses (Optional, for debugging)
  rawPhase1AResponse: String?  // Vision extraction JSON
  rawPhase1BResponse: String?  // Identification JSON
  rawPhase3Response: String?  // Review JSON
}
```

### Storage Strategy

**Auto-save Policy:**
- Phase 1B success: Immediately save to CoreData with basic metadata (artist, album, year, genres, label)
- Phase 2 (artwork fetch): Update existing record with artwork data
- Phase 3 success: Update existing record with review data
- This allows partial saves (can show basic info even if Phase 3 fails)

**Duplicates:**
- Duplicates ARE allowed - every scan creates new entry
- Same album scanned multiple times = multiple CoreData entries
- Users manage duplicates manually via swipe-to-delete in history

**Caching:**
- Review content cached indefinitely (reviews don't change)
- Before Phase 3 call, check CoreData for existing album with matching artist + title
- If exists: Skip Phase 3 API call, use cached review, show Album Details immediately after Loading Screen 2
- If not exists: Make Phase 3 API call, cache result

**Offline Access:**
- All scanned albums viewable without internet
- Artwork stored as Data blobs (both thumbnail and high-res)
- All text content stored locally

**Storage Limits:**
- No app-enforced limit on number of albums
- iPhone storage is the only constraint
- Typical album: ~500KB (artwork) + ~5KB (text) = ~505KB
- 1000 albums ≈ 500MB

---

## CAMERA IMPLEMENTATION

### AVFoundation Framework

**Camera Access:**
- **Framework:** AVCaptureSession for live camera feed
- **Permissions:** Request camera access on first launch (standard iOS flow)
- **Permission Denial:** Show Permission Error Screen with "Open Settings" button

**Camera Settings:**
- **Live Feed:** Camera activates immediately when Screen 1 loads (optimize for speed)
- **Orientation:** Locked to portrait mode only (no landscape support in MVP)
- **Lens:** 1x default zoom (no digital zoom or wide-angle)
- **Performance:** Prioritize speed over quality (minimize processing delays)

**Photo Capture:**
- **Trigger:** SCAN button tap (direct capture, no review/retake in MVP)
- **Format:** JPEG
- **Resolution:** 1024x1024 (square, optimized for album covers and API)
- **Compression:** 1-2MB file size (balance between upload speed and detail)
- **Quality Setting:** Balanced (fast upload, sufficient detail for identification)

**Square Framing Guide:**
- **Overlay:** Square guide centered on screen
- **Outside Guide:** Black overlay with 80% opacity
- **Guide Size:** As large as possible with ~20px margin on left/right
- **Guide Position:** Perfectly centered vertically (measured from top and bottom)
- **Purpose:** Help users center album cover in frame

**Cropping:**
- **When:** After capture, before sending to API
- **What:** Crop to square guide area only
- **Why:** Remove background records/clutter, focus API on target album
- **Implementation:** Extract pixels within guide boundaries, discard rest

### Image Pipeline

```
User taps SCAN 
  → AVCaptureSession captures photo
  → Crop to square guide area (1024x1024)
  → Compress to JPEG (1-2MB)
  → Send to Claude API Phase 1
```

**No Photo Library Access:**
- Direct camera only (no picking from library in MVP)
- Simpler permissions and UX
- Optimized for in-store browsing use case

---

### Caching Strategy

**Memory Cache (NSCache):**
- Hold 20-30 most recently viewed artworks in memory
- Speeds up history scrolling
- Auto-clears on memory pressure
- No manual cache management needed

**Disk Cache (CoreData):**
- Store all downloaded artwork permanently as Data blobs
- Two versions per album:
  - High-res (500px) for detail view
  - Thumbnail (200x200) for history list
- Never expires (artwork doesn't change)

**Cache Key:**
- Prefer MBID (MusicBrainz ID) if available
- Fallback: `"{artist}_{album_title}".lowercased()` hash

**Cache Lookup:**
- Before MusicBrainz call, check CoreData for existing album
- If artwork exists: Use cached, skip all artwork API calls
- If not: Fetch from MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive, cache in CoreData

**Review Cache:**
- Phase 3 reviews cached indefinitely (reviews don't change)
- Before Phase 3 call, check CoreData for existing album
- If review exists: Skip Phase 3 API call, use cached review, show Album Details immediately after Loading Screen 2
- If not: Make Phase 3 API call, cache result in CoreData

---

### User-Agent Header (REQUIRED for MusicBrainz)

MusicBrainz requires a proper User-Agent or requests may be blocked:

```
User-Agent: AlbumScan/1.0 (james@jamesschaffer.com)
```

Include this header in ALL MusicBrainz API requests.

---

### Rate Limiting Compliance

**MusicBrainz:**
- Maximum 1 request per second
- Implement 1-second delay between searches if needed (unlikely in single-user app)
- For multiple simultaneous scans: Queue requests with delay

**Cover Art Archive:**
- No strict limits
- Don't hammer the API (be respectful)
- Single-user app unlikely to hit limits

**Exponential Backoff for Retries:**
- First retry: Immediate
- Second retry: 2 seconds delay
- Third retry: 4 seconds delay
- Give up after 3 retries


### Networking

**Framework:** URLSession (native iOS)

**Timeout Settings:**
- Phase 1 (Claude): 10 seconds
- Phase 2 (Claude): 15 seconds (allows for web search)
- MusicBrainz: 5 seconds
- Cover Art Archive: 5 seconds (query) + 5 seconds (download) = 10 seconds total

**Retry Logic:**
- **Phase 1:** Single auto-retry on transient failures (network glitch), then show error
- **Phase 2:** User-initiated retry via "Retry Review" button (no auto-retry)
- **Artwork:** Single auto-retry, then use placeholder
- **Exponential Backoff:** For rate limit errors (unlikely with Claude)

**HTTPS Only:**
- All API calls over secure connection (HTTPS)
- No insecure HTTP requests

**Error Response Handling:**
- Parse JSON errors from Claude API
- Handle 4xx (client errors) vs 5xx (server errors) differently
- Log errors for debugging (but don't expose to user)

## VERIFICATION SUMMARY

**Document Accuracy:** This document has been verified and corrected against the actual codebase implementation as of October 29, 2025.

**Files Verified:**
- `Config.swift` (LLM provider configuration)
- `OpenAIAPIService.swift` (API calls, models, prompts)
- `CameraManager.swift` (identification flow, search gate, timing, costs)
- `ScanState.swift` (state management enum)
- `CameraView.swift` (error handling)
- `AlbumDetailsView.swift` (review failure display)
- `ScanHistoryView.swift` (caching behavior)
- `single_prompt_identification.txt` (ID Call 1 prompt)
- `search_finalization.txt` (ID Call 2 prompt)
- `album_review.txt` (review generation prompt with 8-tier system)

**Major Corrections Made:**

1. **Architecture Complete Rewrite:** Changed from "FOUR-PHASE API ARCHITECTURE" to "TWO-TIER IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM"
   - Removed: Phase 1A (Vision Extraction), Phase 1B (Web Search Mapping), Phase 2 (Artwork), Phase 3 (Review)
   - Replaced with: ID Call 1, ID Call 2 (conditional), Artwork Retrieval, Review Generation

2. **API Provider:** Changed from Anthropic Claude API to OpenAI API
   - ID Call 1: `gpt-4o` (NO web search)
   - ID Call 2: `gpt-4o-search-preview` (WITH web search, conditional)
   - Review Generation: `gpt-4o` (NO web search - critical October 2025 change)

3. **Cost Estimates:** Updated all costs for OpenAI pricing
   - ID Call 1: ~$0.01 (was ~$0.03 for Claude)
   - ID Call 2: ~$0.03-0.04 (was ~$0.01-0.02 for Claude)
   - Review: ~$0.05-0.10 new, $0.00 cached (was ~$0.15-0.25 for Claude)

4. **Timing Estimates:** Updated for two-tier architecture
   - Without search: 5-7 seconds (was 4-6 seconds)
   - With search: 8-13 seconds (was 7-11 seconds)
   - Confirmation hold: 2.5 seconds (was 2 seconds)

5. **State Management:** Corrected ScanState enum
   - Removed: `.phase1AInProgress`, `.phase1BInProgress`, `.phase2InProgress`, `.phase3InProgress`, `.identificationComplete`
   - Actual: `.idle`, `.identifying`, `.identified`, `.loadingReview`, `.complete`, `.identificationFailed`, `.reviewFailed`

6. **Error Handling:** Fixed all error scenarios
   - Changed from "Scan Error Screen" with "TRY AGAIN" button to error banner (top slide-down, auto-dismiss)
   - Removed all mentions of "Retry Review" button (doesn't exist)
   - Corrected failure flows for two-tier system

7. **Recommendation System:** Fixed from 4 emoji categories to 8-tier text labels
   - Removed: 💎👍😐💩 emojis
   - Added: 8-tier contextual labels (Essential Classic, Indie Masterpiece, etc.)

8. **Caching Strategy:** Updated terminology and added title normalization details
   - Changed "Phase 3 cache" to "Review cache"
   - Added title normalization algorithm (strips Deluxe, Remaster, etc.)
   - Added failure caching (30-day cooldown)
   - Added cache hit rate metrics (70-80%)

9. **Critical October 2025 Model Switch:** Documented review model change
   - Problem: `gpt-4o-search-preview` performed hidden server-side searches ($0.15/review)
   - Solution: Switched to regular `gpt-4o` (zero search capability)
   - Impact: 100% elimination of review search costs
   - Rationale: Music history is stable, search not needed for cultural analysis

10. **API Implementation Examples:** Updated for OpenAI instead of Claude
    - Removed Claude-specific code examples
    - Added OpenAI-specific details (models, timeouts, retry logic)
    - Corrected prompt file references

**Evidence-Based Changes:**
- Config.swift:21 - Verified `currentProvider = .openAI`
- OpenAIAPIService.swift:328 - Verified review uses `gpt-4o` (not search-preview)
- CameraManager.swift:638-650 - Verified search gate implementation (3+ chars, medium/high confidence)
- CameraManager.swift:750 - Verified 2.5-second confirmation hold
- ScanState.swift:5-13 - Verified actual state enum
- CameraView.swift:194-203 - Verified error banner implementation (not full-screen)
- AlbumDetailsView.swift:179 - Verified no retry button (only suggestion message)
- album_review.txt:41-50 - Verified 8-tier recommendation system

**Architecture Verified:**
- Two-tier conditional identification: Call 1 (internal knowledge) → Call 2 (web search, only when needed)
- Search gate validation prevents wasteful searches (3+ chars, medium/high confidence)
- Sequential execution: Identification → Artwork → Review (with caching)
- Progressive disclosure: Loading Screen 1 → Loading Screen 2 (2.5s hold) → Loading Screen 3 → Album Details
- Cost optimization: 80-90% of scans avoid expensive search, aggressive review caching
