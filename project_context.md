- **Version:** 1.0 (MVP)
- **Purpose:** A music discovery companion that reveals the cultural significance and artistic merit of albums through photo identification
- **Target Audience:** Music collectors, vinyl enthusiasts, record store browsers who prioritize artistic value over financial value
- **Platform:** iOS (minimum iOS 16+)
- **Development Approach:** Native iOS using Swift/SwiftUI
- **MVP Scope:** Photo identification + cultural context only. NO Spotify playback integration in MVP.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This iOS application celebrates the joy of music discovery by helping collectors identify albums and understand their cultural significance, artistic merit, and historical impact. When digging through record store bins filled with hundreds of unfamiliar albums, collectors need a knowledgeable companion that can answer: "Is this musically important? Did this influence other artists? Is this album beloved by musicians and critics?"

**This app is deliberately NOT about pricing, pressing values, or financial collectibility.** Instead, this app focuses on the artistic and cultural dimensions of music discovery - helping users find albums that matter because of their sound, innovation, influence, and artistry.

**The MVP is intentionally simple:** Take a photo, identify the album, see rich cultural context and musical significance. That's it. No playback integration, no complex features - just the core discovery loop.

The app uses AI-powered album identification (Claude API) to provide instant context about why an album matters musically. It's like having a passionate music historian in your pocket who can instantly tell you "this is the album that invented shoegaze" or "this obscure funk record was sampled by dozens of hip-hop producers."

## API INTEGRATION

### Anthropic Claude API
- **Purpose:** Album identification via computer vision + cultural context generation
- **Capabilities Used:**
  - Vision API: Analyze album cover photos
  - Text Generation: Create cultural context, ratings, recommendations
  - Web Search: Research current album information (via Claude's built-in tools)
- **API Calls Per Scan:**
  - Single API call that combines vision + text generation
  - Estimated cost: ~$0.10-0.30 per scan (depending on response length)
- **Authentication:** API key (stored securely, not hardcoded)
- **Rate Limits:** Monitor and implement retry logic
- **Caching Strategy:** Cache full responses locally to avoid redundant API calls for same album

### Expected JSON Response Structure
```json
{
  "album_title": "string",
  "artist_name": "string",
  "release_year": "string",
  "genres": ["string"],
  "record_label": "string",
  "context_summary": "string (2-3 sentences)",
  "context_bullets": ["string (3-5 bullets)"],
  "rating": number (0-10),
  "recommendation": "ESSENTIAL|RECOMMENDED|SKIP|AVOID",
  "key_tracks": ["string"],
  "album_art_url": "string (optional)"
}
```

### Recommendation Emojis (Hardcoded in App)
- **ESSENTIAL:** üíé (diamond)
- **RECOMMENDED:** üëç (thumbs up)  
- **SKIP:** üòê (face with diagonal mouth)
- **AVOID:** üí© (poop emoji)

---

## DATA MODEL

### CoreData Schema

#### Album Entity
```swift
Album {
  id: UUID (primary key)
  albumTitle: String
  artistName: String
  releaseYear: String?
  genres: [String]
  recordLabel: String?
  
  // Cultural Context (from Claude API)
  contextSummary: String // 2-3 sentence opening
  contextBulletPoints: [String] // 3-5 bullets
  rating: Double // 0-10
  recommendation: String // ESSENTIAL/RECOMMENDED/SKIP/AVOID
  keyTracks: [String]
  
  // Album Art
  albumArtData: Data? // cached thumbnail
  albumArtURL: String? // high-res reference
  
  // Metadata
  scannedDate: Date
  lastViewedDate: Date?
  
  // Raw API Response (optional, for debugging)
  rawAPIResponse: String?
}
```

### Storage Strategy
- **Auto-save:** Every scan immediately persists to CoreData
- **Duplicates Allowed:** No duplicate detection - every scan creates new entry
- **User Management:** Users delete duplicates manually via swipe-to-delete
- **Album Art Caching:** 
  - Thumbnail (~200x200 JPEG) for history list
  - High-res (original size JPEG) for detail view
  - Both stored as Data in CoreData for offline access
- **Offline Access:** All scanned albums viewable without internet
- **No Size Limit:** Unlimited storage (phone storage is constraint)

---

## CAMERA IMPLEMENTATION

### AVFoundation Framework
- **Camera Access:** AVCaptureSession for live camera feed
- **Photo Capture:** JPEG capture on SCAN button tap
- **Permissions:** Request camera access on first launch
- **No Photo Library:** Direct camera only (no picking from library in MVP)

### Camera Settings
- **Live Feed:** Camera activates immediately when Screen 1 loads
- **Orientation:** Locked to portrait mode only
- **Performance:** Prioritize speed - minimal processing
- **Capture Settings:**
  - Resolution: 1024x1024 (square, optimized for album covers)
  - Format: JPEG compressed to 1-2MB
  - Quality: Balanced (fast upload, sufficient detail for identification)
- **Square Framing Guide:** Overlay guide to help users center album cover

### Image Pipeline
```
User taps SCAN ‚Üí Capture at 1024x1024 ‚Üí Compress to JPEG (1-2MB) ‚Üí Send to API
```

---

## UI/UX REQUIREMENTS

### Design System
- **Follow iOS Guidelines:** Use native iOS patterns and components
- **SF Symbols:** Use Apple's icon library (clock icon for history, etc.)
- **Dark Mode:** Support system dark mode (iOS handles automatically with SwiftUI)
- **Dynamic Type:** Support accessibility text sizing
- **Haptic Feedback:** Subtle haptics on button taps and actions

### Performance Targets
- **App Launch:** < 2 seconds to Camera View
- **API Response:** Display results within 3-5 seconds of scan
- **Screen Transitions:** 60fps, smooth animations
- **History Scrolling:** Smooth scrolling even with 100+ albums
- **Offline Access:** History loads instantly from cache

### Accessibility
- **VoiceOver:** All interactive elements properly labeled
- **Dynamic Type:** Text scales with system settings
- **Color Contrast:** Sufficient contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
- **Tap Targets:** Minimum 44x44pt for all interactive elements

---

## ERROR HANDLING

### Critical Error Scenarios

1. **No Internet Connection**
   - Detect before API call if possible
   - Show user-friendly error message
   - Offer retry button
   - Route to Scan Error Screen (Screen 5)
   
2. **API Failure**
   - Timeout (10 seconds)
   - Invalid response
   - Rate limit hit
   - All route to Scan Error Screen (Screen 5)
   
3. **Camera Issues**
   - Permission denied ‚Üí Permission Error Screen
   - Hardware failure ‚Üí Error message with troubleshooting
   - Poor lighting ‚Üí May affect identification quality (acceptable for MVP)
   
4. **Storage Issues**
   - Disk full ‚Üí Graceful handling (unlikely with album metadata)
   - CoreData failure ‚Üí Alert user, offer to retry
   
5. **Album Not Identified**
   - Claude can't identify album ‚Üí "Couldn't find a match"
   - Route to Scan Error Screen (Screen 5)
   - Single "TRY AGAIN" action for all error types

### Networking
- **Framework:** URLSession (native iOS)
- **Timeout:** 10 seconds
- **Retry Logic:** Single auto-retry on transient failures, then show error
- **HTTPS Only:** All API calls over secure connection

---

## TESTING STRATEGY

### Unit Tests
- CoreData operations (save, fetch, delete)
- API response parsing
- Data model validation
- Caching logic

### Integration Tests
- Camera capture ‚Üí API call ‚Üí Parse response ‚Üí Save to CoreData
- Navigation flows
- Error handling paths

### Manual Testing
- **Critical:** Test at actual record stores with real albums
- Test various lighting conditions
- Test obscure vs popular albums
- Test error scenarios (airplane mode, denied permissions)
- Test on multiple iPhone models if possible

### Test Data
- Maintain a list of known albums for testing
- Include edge cases: damaged covers, partial covers, bootlegs
- Test albums with controversial artists (ensure unbiased assessment)

---

## SECURITY & PRIVACY

### API Key Management
- **NEVER hardcode API keys in source code**
- **Store in:** Xcode build configuration or secure environment variables
- **Git:** Add API keys to .gitignore

### Data Privacy
- **No Analytics:** No tracking or analytics in MVP
- **No External Data Sharing:** Album scan data stays on device
- **Camera Access:** Only used when explicitly triggered by user
- **Privacy Policy:** Required before App Store submission
  - Explain camera usage
  - Explain API data transmission (image sent to Anthropic)
  - Explain local storage only

---

## COST ESTIMATES

### Monthly Costs (Hobby Use)
- **Anthropic Claude API:** ~$10-30/month (50-100 scans)
- **Apple Developer Program:** $99/year (~$8/month)
- **Total:** ~$18-38/month

### Mitigation
- Implement aggressive caching
- Set spending alerts with Anthropic
- Monitor usage weekly

---

## DEVELOPMENT NOTES

### Prompt Management
The Claude API prompt will be maintained as a separate versioned artifact. This allows:
- Independent iteration on prompt quality
- Version control separate from code
- Easy testing of prompt variations
- Clear separation of concerns (product vs engineering)

### Key Navigation Rules
- History icon (clock symbol) only appears after first successful scan
- All scans automatically save to history (including duplicates)
- Single "X" button returns to previous screen
- Single "TRY AGAIN" action for all error types (keep it simple)
- Camera View is the default home screen

### Design Philosophy
- **Speed over perfection:** Get users scanning quickly
- **Simple over complex:** MVP is intentionally minimal
- **Offline-first:** History works without internet
- **Music-focused:** NEVER mention prices or collectibility
