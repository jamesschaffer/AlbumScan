## PROJECT OVERVIEW

- **App Name:** TBD (suggestions: VinylID, AlbumSpot, RecordFinder, SpinID, Crate, DiscoverDisc)
- **Version:** 1.0 (MVP)
- **Purpose:** A music discovery companion that reveals the cultural significance and artistic merit of albums through photo identification
- **Target Audience:** Music collectors, vinyl enthusiasts, record store browsers who prioritize artistic value over financial value
- **Platform:** iOS (minimum iOS 16+)
- **Development Approach:** Native iOS using Swift/SwiftUI
- **MVP Scope:** Photo identification + cultural context only. NO Spotify playback integration in MVP.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This iOS application celebrates the joy of music discovery by helping collectors identify albums and understand their cultural significance, artistic merit, and historical impact. When digging through record store bins filled with hundreds of unfamiliar albums, collectors need a knowledgeable companion that can answer: "Is this musically important? Did this influence other artists? Is this album beloved by musicians and critics?"

**This app is deliberately NOT about pricing, pressing values, or financial collectibility.** Instead, this app focuses on the artistic and cultural dimensions of music discovery - helping users find albums that matter because of their sound, innovation, influence, and artistry.

**The MVP is intentionally simple:** Take a photo, identify the album, see rich cultural context and musical significance. That's it. No playback integration, no complex features - just the core discovery loop.

The app uses AI-powered album identification (Claude API) to provide instant context about why an album matters musically. It's like having a passionate music historian in your pocket who can instantly tell you "this is the album that invented shoegaze" or "this obscure funk record was sampled by dozens of hip-hop producers."

## CORE FEATURES

### Feature 1: Camera-Based Album Identification
- **Priority:** MUST-HAVE (Core feature)
- **Description:** Users can take a photo of any album cover, and the app will identify it using AI vision
- **User Story:** "As a record store browser, I want to take a photo of an album cover so that I can instantly know what album it is and who the artist is"
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Camera View shows live camera feed immediately upon load (optimized for speed)
  - User taps "SCAN" button to capture photo (no review/retake - immediate send)
  - Photo is processed within 3-5 seconds with generic loading spinner
  - App displays album name and artist upon successful identification
  - Takes best match if multiple similar albums exist
  - If identification fails, displays "Couldn't find a match" message with "Try Again" button that returns user to Camera View
  - Works with various cover conditions (worn, angled, partially visible)
  - Stores only the album cover art, NOT the user's original photo

#### Sub-Feature 1A: High-Resolution Album Artwork Retrieval
- **Priority:** MUST-HAVE (Required for Feature 3 display)
- **Description:** After Claude API identifies an album, retrieve high-resolution album artwork from MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive
- **Technical Approach:** Sequential API calls using artist + album metadata
- **User Story:** "As a user, I want to see high-quality album artwork so that I can visually identify and appreciate the album"
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - After Claude API returns album identification (artist name + album title), immediately initiate MusicBrainz artwork search
  - Search MusicBrainz API using artist name and album title to find release MBID (MusicBrainz ID)
  - Use MBID to query Cover Art Archive API for album artwork
  - Retrieve highest quality artwork available (prefer "front" cover image)
  - If Cover Art Archive returns no results, fall back to placeholder: "Album art unavailable"
  - Cache retrieved artwork locally (both thumbnail for history and high-res for detail view)
  - Total artwork retrieval should complete within 2-3 seconds after album identification
  - Handle multiple release variants by selecting the first matching result (prefer original/main release)
  - Artwork URLs should be stored in Album entity for offline reference
  - If MusicBrainz search returns no matches, still display album details with placeholder artwork
  - Artwork retrieval failure should NEVER block album information display

### Feature 2: Cultural Context & Quality Assessment
- **Priority:** MUST-HAVE (Core differentiator)
- **Description:** AI-powered concise album review providing critical assessment, cultural significance, and buying recommendation - explicitly NOT financial value or pricing information
- **User Story:** "As a record store browser, I want a quick, honest assessment of why an album matters musically and whether I should buy it, so I can make informed decisions while flipping through bins"
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Displays 2-3 sentence opening summary capturing the album's core essence and importance
  - Provides 3-5 bullet points (formatted as actual bullets ‚Ä¢) with specific evidence:
    - Critical reception (scores from Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, Metacritic when available)
    - Concrete impact examples (chart performance, sales figures, awards)
    - Specific standout tracks and sonic qualities
    - Genre innovation or influence on other artists
    - Reputation evolution (initially panned vs. later acclaimed, etc.)
  - Includes rating out of 10 (Claude's assessment based on analysis)
  - Provides clear buying recommendation using one of four emoji-badged categories:
    - **ESSENTIAL** üíé - Must own for any serious music collection
    - **RECOMMENDED** üëç - Buy if you're a fan of [specific artist/genre/era]
    - **SKIP** üòê - Not worth your time or money
    - **AVOID** üí© - Actively bad; belongs in the trash
  - Uses honest, direct language - calls out mediocre or bad albums explicitly
  - Focuses on what actually matters about the album (no filler or generic praise)
  - Evaluates albums purely on musical merit - artist's personal controversies or social issues may be mentioned for context but do NOT devalue their musical contributions or impact
  - Explicitly avoids any language about "investment," "value," "rare," "pressing details," or "collectibility"
  - NEVER mentions price, monetary value, or market considerations
  - All content generated via Claude API using a provided prompt that handles web search and formatting internally
  - Shows cached content if album has been scanned before (avoids redundant API calls)

### Feature 3: Album Information Display
- **Priority:** MUST-HAVE
- **Description:** Detailed view showing comprehensive album metadata in a specific visual hierarchy
- **User Story:** "As a music enthusiast, I want to see complete album information so that I can learn about the album before listening"

    1. Album artwork (high resolution) - sourced from Claude API response, with fallback to image search if needed
    2. Artist name and album title
    3. Recommendation badge (ESSENTIAL/RECOMMENDED/SKIP/AVOID with emoji)
    4. Cultural context summary (from Feature 2)
    5. Key Tracks section - Lists most popular/significant tracks from the album (Claude identifies these)
  - Also displays: Release year, genre(s), record label
  - Loads instantly from cache if previously scanned (offline access for historical albums)
  - NO pricing information, pressing details, or market value anywhere

### Feature 4: Scan History
- **Priority:** MUST-HAVE (Makes the app useful beyond single-use)
- **Description:** Simple chronological list of all scanned albums (newest first)
- **User Story:** "As a user, I want to review albums I've scanned so that I can remember what I found interesting"
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Chronologically ordered list (newest first)
  - Shows album cover thumbnail, title, and artist for each entry
  - Every scan is automatically saved to history (including duplicate scans of same album)
  - Users manage their list by swiping to delete unwanted entries

## API INTEGRATION

### Anthropic Claude API
- **Purpose:** Album identification via computer vision + cultural context generation
- **Capabilities Used:**
  - Vision API: Analyze album cover photos
  - Text Generation: Create cultural context, ratings, recommendations
  - Web Search: Research current album information (via Claude's built-in tools)
- **API Calls Per Scan:**
  - Single API call that combines vision + text generation
  - Estimated cost: ~$0.10-0.30 per scan (depending on response length)
- **Authentication:** API key (stored securely, not hardcoded)
- **Rate Limits:** Monitor and implement retry logic
- **Caching Strategy:** Cache full responses locally to avoid redundant API calls for same album

### Expected JSON Response Structure
```json
{
  "album_title": "string",
  "artist_name": "string",
  "release_year": "string",
  "genres": ["string"],
  "record_label": "string",
  "context_summary": "string (2-3 sentences)",
  "context_bullets": ["string (3-5 bullets)"],
  "rating": number (0-10),
  "recommendation": "ESSENTIAL|RECOMMENDED|SKIP|AVOID",
  "key_tracks": ["string"],
  "album_art_url": "string (optional)"
}
```
### MusicBrainz API
- **Purpose:** Search for album releases and retrieve MusicBrainz IDs (MBIDs)
- **Endpoint:** `https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release`
- **Authentication:** None required (open API)
- **Rate Limiting:** 1 request per second (implement with delay if needed)
- **User Agent Required:** Must include custom User-Agent header with app name and contact email

- **Query Parameters:**
  - `query`: Lucene-style search query combining artist and album
  - `fmt`: Response format (use `json`)
  - `limit`: Number of results (use `5` to handle multiple variants)
- **Search Strategy:**
  - Primary search: `artist:{artist_name} AND release:{album_title}`
  - If no results: Try fuzzy search with `artist:{artist_name} release:{album_title}~`
  - Select first result with matching artist name (case-insensitive)
- **Response Contains:** Release MBID, release title, artist credit, date, country
- **Caching:** Cache MBIDs with album metadata to avoid repeat searches

**Example Request:**
```
GET https://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/release?query=artist:Radiohead%20AND%20release:OK%20Computer&fmt=json&limit=5
```

### Cover Art Archive API

   - All route to Scan Error Screen (Screen 5)
   
3. **Camera Issues**
   - Permission denied ‚Üí Permission Error Screen
   - Hardware failure ‚Üí Error message with troubleshooting
   - Poor lighting ‚Üí May affect identification quality (acceptable for MVP)
   
4. **Storage Issues**
   - Disk full ‚Üí Graceful handling (unlikely with album metadata)
   - CoreData failure ‚Üí Alert user, offer to retry
   
5. **Album Not Identified**
   - Claude can't identify album ‚Üí "Couldn't find a match"
   - Route to Scan Error Screen (Screen 5)
   - Single "TRY AGAIN" action for all error types

6. **Album Artwork Retrieval Failures**
   - MusicBrainz search returns no results ‚Üí Use placeholder, continue display
   - Cover Art Archive returns 404 ‚Üí Use placeholder, continue display
   - Network timeout during artwork download ‚Üí Use placeholder, continue display
   - Image download fails or corrupted ‚Üí Use placeholder, continue display
   - **Important:** All artwork failures are non-blocking - album information always displays
   - Consider retry logic: If artwork fails, store flag and allow manual refresh in future

### Networking
- **Framework:** URLSession (native iOS)
- **Timeout:** 10 seconds
- **Retry Logic:** Single auto-retry on transient failures, then show error
- **HTTPS Only:** All API calls over secure connection

---

## TESTING STRATEGY

### Unit Tests
- CoreData operations (save, fetch, delete)
- API response parsing
- Data model validation
- Caching logic

### Integration Tests
- Camera capture ‚Üí API call ‚Üí Parse response ‚Üí Save to CoreData
- Navigation flows
- Error handling paths
- MusicBrainz search ‚Üí Parse MBID ‚Üí Cover Art Archive query ‚Üí Image download ‚Üí Cache storage
- Test artwork retrieval with popular albums (high success rate)
- Test artwork retrieval with obscure albums (expect some failures)
- Test placeholder display when artwork unavailable
- Test offline behavior (cached artwork displays, non-cached shows placeholder)

### Manual Testing
- **Critical:** Test at actual record stores with real albums
- Test various lighting conditions
- Test obscure vs popular albums
- Test error scenarios (airplane mode, denied permissions)
- Test on multiple iPhone models if possible
- Test artwork quality on various iPhone screen sizes
- Test artwork loading speed on slow network connections
- Test albums with multiple releases (ensure correct variant selected)
- Test non-English album titles and artist names
- Test albums known to be missing from Cover Art Archive

### Test Data
- Maintain a list of known albums for testing
- Include edge cases: damaged covers, partial covers, bootlegs
- Test albums with controversial artists (ensure unbiased assessment)

---

## SECURITY & PRIVACY

### API Key Management
- **NEVER hardcode API keys in source code**
- **Store in:** Xcode build configuration or secure environment variables
- **Git:** Add API keys to .gitignore

### Data Privacy
- **No Analytics:** No tracking or analytics in MVP
- **No External Data Sharing:** Album scan data stays on device
- **Camera Access:** Only used when explicitly triggered by user
- **Privacy Policy:** Required before App Store submission
  - Explain camera usage
  - Explain API data transmission (image sent to Anthropic)
  - Explain local storage only

---

## COST ESTIMATES

### Monthly Costs (Hobby Use)
- **Anthropic Claude API:** ~$10-30/month (50-100 scans)
- **Apple Developer Program:** $99/year (~$8/month)
- **Total:** ~$18-38/month

### Mitigation
- Implement aggressive caching

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Artwork Retrieval Priority
- Speed is critical: Users should see album info + artwork within 5-8 seconds total
- Artwork retrieval happens in parallel with UI rendering of text content
- Never block album information display waiting for artwork
- Implement aggressive timeout (5 seconds max for entire artwork retrieval process)

### Caching Strategy
- **Memory Cache:** NSCache holds recently viewed artwork (limit to 20-30 images)
- **Disk Cache:** FileManager stores all downloaded artwork permanently
- **Cache Key:** Use MBID or fallback to "{artist}_{album_title}" hash
- **Cache Invalidation:** No automatic expiration (artwork doesn't change)

### User-Agent Header (REQUIRED)
MusicBrainz requires a proper User-Agent or requests may be blocked:
```
User-Agent: VinylID/1.0 (james@jamesschaffer.com)
```

### Rate Limiting Compliance
- MusicBrainz: Maximum 1 request per second
- Implement 1-second delay between searches if needed
- Cover Art Archive: No strict limits, but don't hammer the API
- Consider implementing exponential backoff for retries

### Placeholder Artwork Design
- Neutral gray background (#E5E5E5 for light mode, #2C2C2C for dark mode)
- Centered text: "Album art unavailable"
- Match aspect ratio of album covers (1:1 square)
- Subtle icon (optional): music note or vinyl record symbol

## DEVELOPMENT NOTES

### Prompt Management
The Claude API prompt will be maintained as a separate versioned artifact. This allows:
- Independent iteration on prompt quality
- Version control separate from code
- Easy testing of prompt variations
- Clear separation of concerns (product vs engineering)

### Key Navigation Rules
- History icon (clock symbol) only appears after first successful scan
- All scans automatically save to history (including duplicates)
- Single "X" button returns to previous screen
- Single "TRY AGAIN" action for all error types (keep it simple)
- Camera View is the default home screen

### Design Philosophy
- **Speed over perfection:** Get users scanning quickly
- **Simple over complex:** MVP is intentionally minimal
- **Offline-first:** History works without internet
- **Music-focused:** NEVER mention prices or collectibility
