## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This iOS application celebrates the joy of music discovery by helping collectors identify albums and understand their cultural significance, artistic merit, and historical impact. When digging through record store bins filled with hundreds of unfamiliar albums, collectors need a knowledgeable companion that can answer: "Is this musically important? Did this influence other artists? Is this album beloved by musicians and critics?"

**This app is deliberately NOT about pricing, pressing values, or financial collectibility.** Instead, this app focuses on the artistic and cultural dimensions of music discovery - helping users find albums that matter because of their sound, innovation, influence, and artistry.

**Key Innovation: Four-Phase API Strategy**
The app uses a sequential four-phase approach that optimizes for accuracy, speed, and cost:
- **Phase 1A (1-2 seconds):** Vision extraction - Extract visible text and describe cover artwork
- **Phase 1B (1-2 seconds):** Web search mapping - Identify album using extracted data + web search
- **Phase 2 (2-3 seconds):** Artwork retrieval - Fetch high-resolution album art from MusicBrainz
- **Phase 3 (3-5 seconds):** Review generation - Generate cultural analysis and buying recommendation

This architecture ensures accurate album identification (Phases 1A/1B handle edge cases like acronyms and minimal text), confirms the match with users (2-second preview), then generates expensive review content only after successful identification.

The app uses AI-powered album identification (Claude API) to provide instant context about why an album matters musically. It's like having a passionate music historian in your pocket who can instantly tell you "this is the album that invented shoegaze" or "this obscure funk record was sampled by dozens of hip-hop producers."

## CORE FEATURES

### Feature 1: Camera-Based Album Identification
- **Priority:** MUST-HAVE (Core feature)
- **Description:** Users can take a photo of any album cover, and the app will identify it using AI vision
- **User Story:** "As a record store browser, I want to take a photo of an album cover so that I can instantly know what album it is and who the artist is"
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Camera View shows live camera feed immediately upon load (optimized for speed)
  - User taps "SCAN" button to capture photo (no review/retake - immediate send)
  - Photo is processed via four-phase API approach:
    - Phase 1A: Vision extraction (1-2 seconds)
    - Phase 1B: Web search mapping (1-2 seconds)
    - Phase 2: Artwork retrieval (2-3 seconds)
    - Phase 3: Review generation (3-5 seconds)
  - App displays album name, artist, and artwork after Phase 2 completion (2-second confirmation screen)
  - If Phases 1A/1B/2 fail, displays "Couldn't find a match" message with "Try Again" button
  - Phase 3 runs after 2-second confirmation screen
  - If Phase 3 fails, shows album details with "Review temporarily unavailable" + retry button
  - Works with various cover conditions (worn, angled, partially visible, minimal text, acronyms)
  - Stores only the album cover art from MusicBrainz, NOT the user's original photo

#### Sub-Feature 1A: High-Resolution Album Artwork Retrieval
- **Priority:** MUST-HAVE (Required for Feature 3 display)
- **Description:** After Phase 1B identifies album metadata, retrieve high-resolution album artwork from MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive (Phase 2)
- **Technical Approach:** Sequential API calls using artist + album metadata from Phase 1B
- **User Story:** "As a user, I want to see high-quality album artwork so that I can visually identify and appreciate the album"
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - After Phase 1B returns album identification, immediately initiate MusicBrainz artwork search (Phase 2)
  - Search MusicBrainz API using artist name and album title to find release MBID (MusicBrainz ID)
  - Use MBID to query Cover Art Archive API for album artwork
  - Retrieve highest quality artwork available (prefer "front" cover image)
  - If Cover Art Archive returns no results, fall back to placeholder: "Album art unavailable"
  - Cache retrieved artwork locally (both thumbnail for history and high-res for detail view)
  - Total artwork retrieval should complete within 2-3 seconds
  - Handle multiple release variants by selecting the first matching result (prefer original/main release)
  - Artwork URLs should be stored in Album entity for offline reference
  - If MusicBrainz search returns no matches, still display album details with placeholder artwork
  - Artwork retrieval failure should NEVER block album information display

### Feature 2: Cultural Context & Quality Assessment
- **Priority:** MUST-HAVE (Core differentiator)
- **Description:** AI-powered concise album review providing critical assessment, cultural significance, and buying recommendation - explicitly NOT financial value or pricing information
- **User Story:** "As a record store browser, I want a quick, honest assessment of why an album matters musically and whether I should buy it, so I can make informed decisions while flipping through bins"
- **Architecture:** Generated in Phase 3 (after successful identification and artwork retrieval), uses web search for current information
- **Input:** Receives clean metadata from Phase 1B (artist name, album title, release year, genres, record label)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Phase 3 prompt receives ONLY metadata (no album identification task)
  - Displays 2-3 sentence opening summary capturing the album's core essence and importance
  - Provides 3-5 bullet points (formatted as actual bullets ‚Ä¢) with specific evidence:
    - Critical reception (scores from Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, Metacritic when available)
    - Concrete impact examples (chart performance, sales figures, awards)
    - Specific standout tracks and sonic qualities
    - Genre innovation or influence on other artists
    - Reputation evolution (initially panned vs. later acclaimed, etc.)
  - Includes rating out of 10 (Claude's assessment based on analysis)
  - Provides clear buying recommendation using one of four emoji-badged categories:
    - **ESSENTIAL** üíé - Must own for any serious music collection
    - **RECOMMENDED** üëç - Buy if you're a fan of [specific artist/genre/era]
    - **SKIP** üòê - Not worth your time or money
    - **AVOID** üí© - Actively bad; belongs in the trash
  - Uses honest, direct language - calls out mediocre or bad albums explicitly
  - Focuses on what actually matters about the album (no filler or generic praise)
  - Evaluates albums purely on musical merit - artist's personal controversies or social issues may be mentioned for context but do NOT devalue their musical contributions or impact
  - Explicitly avoids any language about "investment," "value," "rare," "pressing details," or "collectibility"
  - NEVER mentions price, monetary value, or market considerations
  - All content generated via Claude API Phase 3 using web search for research
  - Shows cached content if album has been scanned before (avoids redundant API calls)
  - If Phase 3 fails, displays album details with "Review temporarily unavailable" + retry button (retry only calls Phase 3, not full scan)

### Feature 3: Album Information Display
- **Priority:** MUST-HAVE
- **Description:** Detailed view showing comprehensive album metadata in a specific visual hierarchy

## FOUR-PHASE API ARCHITECTURE

### Overview
AlbumScan uses a sequential four-phase API strategy that optimizes for identification accuracy, speed, cost, and user experience.

**Key Benefits:**
1. **Accurate Identification:** Separate vision extraction from web search mapping handles edge cases (acronyms, minimal text, visual-only covers)
2. **Fail Fast:** Users know within 6 seconds if scan worked (Phases 1A/1B/2)
3. **Lower Cost on Failures:** Failed IDs cost ~$0.04-0.05 instead of $0.20-0.30
4. **User Confirmation:** 2-second hold shows matched album before expensive review generation
5. **Progressive Disclosure:** Users see results incrementally (feels faster)
6. **Better Error Handling:** Can show partial results if review fails
7. **Optimization Opportunities:** Can cache each phase independently
8. **Future-Proof:** Could add alternative review sources without re-identifying

---

**On Success:**
- Display full review in Album Details Screen
- Save complete album data to CoreData (metadata from Phase 1B + artwork from Phase 2 + review from Phase 3)
- Cache review for future scans of same album

**On Failure:**
- Still display Album Details Screen with:
  - Album artwork (already fetched in Phase 2)
  - Basic metadata (from Phase 1B: artist, album, year, genres, label)
  - Error message: "Review temporarily unavailable"
  - "Retry Review" button that re-triggers only Phase 3
- User can retry Phase 3 without re-scanning or paying for Phase 1A/1B/2 again

### State Management Requirements

**SwiftUI State Enum:**
```swift
enum ScanState {
    case idle                          // Camera view, ready to scan
    case phase1AInProgress             // Vision extraction running
    case phase1BInProgress             // Web search mapping running
    case phase2InProgress              // Artwork retrieval running
    case identificationComplete        // Phases 1A/1B/2 complete, showing Loading Screen 2 (2-sec hold)
    case phase3InProgress              // Review generation running
    case complete                      // All phases done, showing Album Details
    case identificationFailed          // Phase 1A/1B/2 failed
    case reviewFailed                  // Phases 1A/1B/2 worked, Phase 3 failed
}
```

**Album Data Structure:**
```swift
struct AlbumScanData {
    // Phase 1A data (vision extraction)
    var extractedText: String?
    var albumDescription: String?
    var phase1ACompleted: Bool = false
    
    // Phase 1B data (identification metadata)
    var artistName: String?
    var albumTitle: String?
    var releaseYear: String?
    var genres: [String]?
    var recordLabel: String?
    var phase1BCompleted: Bool = false
    
    // Phase 2 data (artwork)
    var albumArtwork: UIImage?
    var artworkLoaded: Bool = false
    var musicbrainzID: String?
    var phase2Completed: Bool = false
    
    // Phase 3 data (review)
    var contextSummary: String?
    var contextBullets: [String]?
    var rating: Double?
    var recommendation: String?
    var keyTracks: [String]?

### Error Handling in Four-Phase System

**Scenario 1: Phase 1A/1B/2 Fails (Identification or Artwork)**
- User Experience: Scan Error Screen - "Couldn't find a match"
- User Action: Tap "TRY AGAIN" ‚Üí Camera View
- Cost Impact: ~$0.04-0.05 (no Phase 3 call)
- System Behavior: Phase 3 never triggered

**Scenario 2: Phase 1A/1B/2 Succeeds, Phase 3 Fails**
- User Experience: Album Details Screen with:
  - Album artwork (from Phase 2, or placeholder if Phase 2 failed)
  - Basic metadata (artist, title, year, genre, label from Phase 1B)
  - Error in review area: "Review temporarily unavailable"
  - "Retry Review" button (only re-runs Phase 3)
- Cost Impact: Phase 1A/1B (~$0.04-0.05) initially, Phase 3 cost (~$0.05-0.10) on retry
- System Behavior: Partial success is better than total failure

**Scenario 3: Phase 2 Artwork Fails, Everything Else Succeeds**
- User Experience: Album Details Screen with:
  - Placeholder artwork
  - Full review from Phase 3
  - All metadata visible
- Non-blocking error: Review displays normally
- Cost Impact: Full cost (~$0.09-0.15)

**Scenario 4: Network Failure Mid-Process**
- If Phase 1A/1B/2 in progress: Show error, retry from beginning (Scan Error Screen)
- If Phase 3 in progress: Show partial results (artwork + metadata) with "Retry Review" button
- Network recovery: User can retry without re-scanning

---

### Caching Strategy for Four-Phase System

**Phase 1A/1B Cache (Identification):**
- **Decision:** Do NOT cache Phase 1A/1B results by image
- **Reasoning:** 
  - Image hashing is expensive
  - Phase 1A/1B is fast (2-4s total) and cheap ($0.04-0.05)
  - User rarely scans exact same photo twice
  - Not worth the complexity

**Phase 3 Cache (Review):**
- **Cache Key:** `"{artistName}_{albumTitle}".lowercased().replacingOccurrences(of: " ", with: "_")`
- **Cache Location:** CoreData (part of Album entity)
- **Cache Duration:** Never expires (reviews don't change)
- **Cache Check:** Before Phase 2 API call:
  - Query CoreData for existing album with matching artist + title
  - If exists ‚Üí Skip Phase 2 API call, display cached review immediately
  - If not exists ‚Üí Make Phase 2 API call, cache result in CoreData
- **Cache Savings:** Huge cost reduction for duplicate album scans

**Artwork Cache:**
- **Cache Key:** MBID (MusicBrainz ID) or `"{artist}_{album}"` fallback
- **Cache Location:** CoreData as Data blobs (both 500px and 200px versions)
- **Cache Duration:** Never expires (artwork doesn't change)
- **Cache Check:** Before MusicBrainz call:
  - If album exists in CoreData with artwork ‚Üí Use cached artwork, skip API calls
  - If not exists ‚Üí Fetch from MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive, cache in CoreData

**Memory Cache (NSCache):**
- Hold 20-30 most recently viewed artworks in memory
- Speeds up history scrolling
- Auto-clears on memory pressure

---

### API Implementation Notes

**Phase 1 API Call (Swift):**
```swift
let phase1Response = await claudeAPI.identifyAlbum(
    image: capturedPhoto,
    prompt: phase1IdentificationPrompt,
    enableWebSearch: false,  // CRITICAL: disable for speed
    maxTokens: 300,
    temperature: 0.0  // Deterministic for identification
)
```

**Phase 2 API Call (Swift):**
```swift
// Check cache first
if let cachedAlbum = await coreDataManager.fetchAlbum(
    artist: artistName, 
    title: albumTitle
) {
    // Use cached review, skip API call
    return cachedAlbum
}

// No cache, make API call
let phase2Response = await claudeAPI.generateReview(
    metadata: "Artist: \(artist), Album: \(album), Year: \(year), Genre: \(genres.joined(separator: ", ")), Label: \(label)",
    prompt: phase2ReviewPrompt,
    enableWebSearch: true,  // Enable research
    maxTokens: 1500,
    temperature: 0.3  // Slightly creative for review
)
```

**Parallel Execution Pattern:**
```swift
async let artworkTask = fetchArtwork(artist: artistName, album: albumTitle)
async let reviewTask = generateReview(artist: artistName, album: albumTitle)

let (artwork, review) = await (artworkTask, reviewTask)
```

---

## DATA MODEL

### CoreData Schema

#### Album Entity

```swift
Album {
  // Primary Key
  id: UUID (primary key)
  
  // Phase 1A Data (Vision Extraction) - Not stored, only used for Phase 1B
  // extractedText and albumDescription are temporary, not persisted
  
  // Phase 1B Data (Identification Metadata)
  artistName: String
  albumTitle: String
  releaseYear: String?
  genres: [String]  // Array stored as JSON or comma-separated
  recordLabel: String?
  phase1BCompleted: Bool  // Track if identification succeeded
  
  // Phase 2 Data (Artwork)
  musicbrainzID: String?  // MBID for future reference
  albumArtURL: String?  // Cover Art Archive URL (large/500px)
  albumArtThumbnailData: Data?  // Cached 200x200 JPEG for history
  albumArtHighResData: Data?  // Cached 500px JPEG for detail view
  albumArtRetrievalFailed: Bool  // Track if artwork lookup failed
  phase2Completed: Bool  // Track if artwork fetch completed
  
  // Phase 3 Data (Review)
  contextSummary: String?  // 2-3 sentence opening
  contextBulletPoints: [String]  // 3-5 bullets, stored as JSON or comma-separated
  rating: Double?  // 0-10
  recommendation: String?  // ESSENTIAL/RECOMMENDED/SKIP/AVOID
  keyTracks: [String]  // Stored as JSON or comma-separated
  phase3Completed: Bool  // Track if Phase 3 succeeded
  phase3Failed: Bool  // Track if Phase 3 needs retry
  phase3LastAttempt: Date?  // When we last tried Phase 3 (for retry logic)
  
  // Metadata
  scannedDate: Date  // When user first scanned this
  lastViewedDate: Date?  // Last time user opened this album in history
  
  // Raw API Responses (Optional, for debugging)
  rawPhase1AResponse: String?  // Vision extraction JSON
  rawPhase1BResponse: String?  // Identification JSON
  rawPhase3Response: String?  // Review JSON
}
```

### Storage Strategy

**Auto-save Policy:**
- Phase 1B success: Immediately save to CoreData with basic metadata (artist, album, year, genres, label)
- Phase 2 (artwork fetch): Update existing record with artwork data
- Phase 3 success: Update existing record with review data
- This allows partial saves (can show basic info even if Phase 3 fails)

**Duplicates:**
- Duplicates ARE allowed - every scan creates new entry
- Same album scanned multiple times = multiple CoreData entries
- Users manage duplicates manually via swipe-to-delete in history

**Caching:**
- Review content cached indefinitely (reviews don't change)
- Before Phase 3 call, check CoreData for existing album with matching artist + title
- If exists: Skip Phase 3 API call, use cached review, show Album Details immediately after Loading Screen 2
- If not exists: Make Phase 3 API call, cache result

**Offline Access:**
- All scanned albums viewable without internet
- Artwork stored as Data blobs (both thumbnail and high-res)
- All text content stored locally

**Storage Limits:**
- No app-enforced limit on number of albums
- iPhone storage is the only constraint
- Typical album: ~500KB (artwork) + ~5KB (text) = ~505KB
- 1000 albums ‚âà 500MB

---

## CAMERA IMPLEMENTATION

### AVFoundation Framework

**Camera Access:**
- **Framework:** AVCaptureSession for live camera feed
- **Permissions:** Request camera access on first launch (standard iOS flow)
- **Permission Denial:** Show Permission Error Screen with "Open Settings" button

**Camera Settings:**
- **Live Feed:** Camera activates immediately when Screen 1 loads (optimize for speed)
- **Orientation:** Locked to portrait mode only (no landscape support in MVP)
- **Lens:** 1x default zoom (no digital zoom or wide-angle)
- **Performance:** Prioritize speed over quality (minimize processing delays)

**Photo Capture:**
- **Trigger:** SCAN button tap (direct capture, no review/retake in MVP)
- **Format:** JPEG
- **Resolution:** 1024x1024 (square, optimized for album covers and API)
- **Compression:** 1-2MB file size (balance between upload speed and detail)
- **Quality Setting:** Balanced (fast upload, sufficient detail for identification)

**Square Framing Guide:**
- **Overlay:** Square guide centered on screen
- **Outside Guide:** Black overlay with 80% opacity
- **Guide Size:** As large as possible with ~20px margin on left/right
- **Guide Position:** Perfectly centered vertically (measured from top and bottom)
- **Purpose:** Help users center album cover in frame

**Cropping:**
- **When:** After capture, before sending to API
- **What:** Crop to square guide area only
- **Why:** Remove background records/clutter, focus API on target album
- **Implementation:** Extract pixels within guide boundaries, discard rest

### Image Pipeline

```
User taps SCAN 
  ‚Üí AVCaptureSession captures photo
  ‚Üí Crop to square guide area (1024x1024)
  ‚Üí Compress to JPEG (1-2MB)
  ‚Üí Send to Claude API Phase 1
```

**No Photo Library Access:**
- Direct camera only (no picking from library in MVP)
- Simpler permissions and UX
- Optimized for in-store browsing use case

---

## UI/UX REQUIREMENTS

### Design System

**iOS Native Patterns:**
- Follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines
- Use native SwiftUI components where possible
- Standard iOS navigation patterns (X button, swipe gestures)

**SF Symbols:**
- Use Apple's icon library for all icons
- Clock icon for history
- X icon for close/dismiss
- Camera icon if needed

**Dark Mode:**

- SwiftUI handles automatically with proper color definitions
- Test both light and dark modes
- Primary screens (loading, camera) use black background

**Dynamic Type:**
- Support accessibility text sizing
- Text scales with system settings
- Ensure readability at all sizes

**Haptic Feedback:**
- Subtle haptics on button taps (SCAN, TRY AGAIN, etc.)
- Haptic on successful scan (light impact)
- Haptic on error (notification feedback)

### Performance Targets

**App Launch:**
- < 2 seconds from icon tap to Camera View ready
- Camera feed activates immediately (no black screen)

**Phase 1 Response:**
- 2-4 seconds target
- Display results within 5 seconds max (including network)

**Phase 2 Response:**
- 3-6 seconds target

**Offline Access:**
- History loads instantly from CoreData cache
- No loading spinner for cached albums

### Accessibility

**VoiceOver:**
- All interactive elements properly labeled
- Descriptive labels for images
- Logical navigation order

**Dynamic Type:**
- Text scales with system settings (see above)
- Minimum 17pt body text
- Test at largest accessibility sizes

**Color Contrast:**
- Sufficient contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
- White text on black background (primary screens)
- Test in both light and dark modes

**Tap Targets:**
- Minimum 44x44pt for all interactive elements
- Large SCAN button (easy to tap while holding phone)
- Generous spacing between tappable elements

---

## ERROR HANDLING

### Critical Error Scenarios

**1. No Internet Connection**
- **Detection:** Before Phase 1 API call if possible
- **User Experience:** Alert: "No internet connection. Please check your connection and try again."
- **Action:** "OK" button dismisses alert, returns to Camera View
- **Phase 1 Behavior:** Don't attempt API call if no connection
- **Phase 2 Behavior:** If Phase 1 succeeded offline (cached), allow Phase 2 to fail gracefully

**2. Phase 1 API Failure (Identification)**
- **Causes:**
  - Network timeout (10 seconds)
  - Invalid response from Claude API
  - Rate limit hit
  - Server error (5xx)
  - Album genuinely not identifiable
- **User Experience:** Screen 5 (Scan Error)
- **Message:** "Couldn't find a match"
- **Hint Text:** "Make sure the front of the album cover is clear and fills the frame"
- **Action:** "TRY AGAIN" button ‚Üí Camera View
- **Cost:** ~$0.03-0.05 (no Phase 2 call)

**3. Phase 2 API Failure (Review Generation)**
- **Causes:**
  - Network timeout
  - Invalid response
  - Web search failures
  - Server error
- **User Experience:** Album Details (Screen 3) with:
  - Real artwork (if available)
  - Basic metadata from Phase 1
  - Error message: "Review temporarily unavailable"
  - "Retry Review" button
- **Action:** "Retry Review" ‚Üí Re-runs only Phase 2 (not Phase 1 or artwork)
- **Behavior:** Partial success - user still knows what album it is

**4. Camera Issues**
- **Permission Denied:**
  - Show Permission Error Screen
  - "Open Settings" button ‚Üí iOS Settings app
  - User grants permission ‚Üí Return to app ‚Üí Camera View
- **Hardware Failure:**
  - Alert: "Camera unavailable. Please restart the app."
  - "OK" button dismisses alert
  - Graceful degradation (don't crash)
- **Poor Lighting:**
  - No client-side detection (let Claude handle in Phase 1)
  - May affect identification quality (acceptable for MVP)
  - User will retry naturally if scan fails

**5. Storage Issues**
- **Disk Full:**
  - CoreData save fails ‚Üí Alert: "Unable to save album. Storage may be full."
  - Graceful handling (scan still completes, just not saved)
  - Unlikely with album metadata (small data size)
- **CoreData Failure:**
  - Alert: "An error occurred. Please try again."
  - Offer retry button
  - Log error for debugging

**6. Album Not Identified (Phase 1 Returns Error)**
- **User Experience:** Screen 5 (Scan Error) - "Couldn't find a match"
- **Action:** "TRY AGAIN" button ‚Üí Camera View
- **Common Causes:**
  - Not an album cover (random object)
  - Back cover of album
  - Too blurry/partial/far away
  - Multiple albums in frame
  - Bootleg/unofficial release

**7. Album Artwork Retrieval Failures**
- **MusicBrainz Search Returns No Results:**
  - Use placeholder: "Album art unavailable"
  - Continue displaying album details
  - Non-blocking error
- **Cover Art Archive Returns 404:**
  - Use placeholder (common for obscure releases)
  - Continue displaying album details
- **Network Timeout During Artwork Download:**
  - Use placeholder after 5 second timeout
  - Don't block Phase 2 review display
- **Image Download Fails or Corrupted:**
  - Use placeholder
  - Continue displaying album details
- **Important:** All artwork failures are non-blocking - album information always displays

### Networking

**Framework:** URLSession (native iOS)

**Timeout Settings:**
- Phase 1 (Claude): 10 seconds
- Phase 2 (Claude): 15 seconds (allows for web search)
- MusicBrainz: 5 seconds
- Cover Art Archive: 5 seconds (query) + 5 seconds (download) = 10 seconds total

**Retry Logic:**
- **Phase 1:** Single auto-retry on transient failures (network glitch), then show error
- **Phase 2:** User-initiated retry via "Retry Review" button (no auto-retry)
- **Artwork:** Single auto-retry, then use placeholder
- **Exponential Backoff:** For rate limit errors (unlikely with Claude)

**HTTPS Only:**
- All API calls over secure connection (HTTPS)
- No insecure HTTP requests

**Error Response Handling:**
- Parse JSON errors from Claude API
- Handle 4xx (client errors) vs 5xx (server errors) differently
- Log errors for debugging (but don't expose to user)

---

## TESTING STRATEGY

### Unit Tests

**CoreData Operations:**
- Save album to CoreData (Phase 1 data only)
- Update album with Phase 2 data
- Update album with artwork data
- Fetch album by artist + title (cache check)
- Delete album from history
- Query all albums (sorted by date)

**API Response Parsing:**
- Parse Phase 1 success JSON
- Parse Phase 1 error JSON
- Parse Phase 2 success JSON
- Handle malformed JSON gracefully
- Parse MusicBrainz response
- Parse Cover Art Archive response

**Data Model Validation:**
- Album entity saves correctly
- Arrays (genres, bullets, tracks) serialize/deserialize
- Data blobs (artwork) save and load correctly
- Date fields save correctly

**Caching Logic:**
- Check cache before Phase 2 call
- Cache review after Phase 2 success
- Cache artwork after download
- Cache lookup by artist + title

### Manual Testing

**Critical Real-World Testing:**
- **Test at actual record stores** with real albums (most important)
- Test various lighting conditions (bright, dim, overhead lights)
- Test obscure vs popular albums
- Test worn/damaged covers
- Test angled shots (not perfectly straight)
- Test partially visible covers

**Device Testing:**
- Test on multiple iPhone models if possible (different screen sizes)
- Test on oldest supported iOS version (iOS 16.0)
- Test on latest iOS version
- Test both light and dark modes

**Edge Case Testing:**
- Back cover of album (should error)
- Multiple albums in frame (should error)
- Non-album objects (should error)
- Bootleg/unofficial releases (may error)
- Albums with multiple releases (should pick one)

**Artwork Testing:**
- Popular albums (high success rate)
- Obscure albums (expect some failures)
- Non-English titles and artist names
- Albums known to be missing from Cover Art Archive
- Artwork quality on various iPhone screen sizes
- Artwork loading on slow network

**Error Scenario Testing:**
- Airplane mode (no internet)
- Permission denied (camera access)
- Timeout scenarios (slow network)
- Server errors (mock 5xx responses)
- Rate limiting (unlikely but test if possible)

**Performance Testing:**
- Scroll history with 100+ albums (smooth?)
- App launch time (< 2 seconds?)
- Phase 1 response time (< 4 seconds average?)
- Phase 2 response time (< 6 seconds average?)
- Memory usage (no leaks?)

- The Beatles - Let It Be (1970) - Mixed critical consensus

**Poorly Received Albums (Should rate low):**
- Madonna - MDNA (2012)
- Earth Wind & Fire - Electric Universe (1983)

**Obscure Albums:**
- Test with local/regional releases
- Test with non-US releases
- Test with albums missing from Cover Art Archive

**Edge Cases:**
- Bootleg releases
- Picture discs
- Colored vinyl (different artwork variants)
- Reissues with different artwork
- Box sets
- Singles vs albums

## SECURITY & PRIVACY

### API Key Management

**NEVER hardcode API keys in source code.**

**Storage Options:**
- **Xcode Build Configuration:** Store in xcconfig file (add to .gitignore)
- **Environment Variables:** Use Xcode build settings
- **Keychain:** For production apps (overkill for MVP)

**Git:**
- Add API keys to .gitignore
- Add xcconfig files to .gitignore
- Never commit sensitive credentials

**Best Practice:**
```swift
// Read from build configuration
let apiKey = Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: "CLAUDE_API_KEY") as? String
```

### Data Privacy

**No Analytics:**
- No tracking or analytics in MVP
- No user behavior logging
- No telemetry

**No External Data Sharing:**
- Album scan data stays on device
- No cloud sync (CoreData local only)
- No third-party SDKs

**Camera Access:**
- Only used when explicitly triggered by user (SCAN button)
- Not running in background
- Not accessing photo library

**API Data Transmission:**
- Album cover photo sent to Anthropic Claude API (Phase 1)
- Album metadata sent to Anthropic Claude API (Phase 2)
- Album metadata sent to MusicBrainz (for artwork)
- No personal user data transmitted
- All API calls over HTTPS

**Privacy Policy (Required for App Store):**
Before App Store submission, create privacy policy explaining:
- Camera usage (to capture album covers)
- API data transmission (image sent to Anthropic for identification)
- Local storage only (no cloud sync)
- No data sharing with third parties
- No user tracking or analytics

---

## COST ESTIMATES

### Monthly Costs (Hobby Use)

**API Costs:**
- **Anthropic Claude API:**
  - Successful scans: ~$0.18-0.30 per scan
  - Failed scans: ~$0.03-0.05 per scan
  - Estimated usage: 50-100 scans/month
  - Estimated cost: $10-30/month (depending on success rate)
  
**Infrastructure:**
- **Apple Developer Program:** $99/year (~$8/month)
- **MusicBrainz:** Free (open API)
- **Cover Art Archive:** Free (open API)

**Total Monthly Cost:** ~$18-38/month

### Cost Mitigation Strategies

**Caching:**
- Aggressive Phase 2 caching (never re-generate reviews for same album)
- Artwork caching (never re-fetch artwork for same album)
- Expected savings: 50-70% for users who scan duplicates

**Fail Fast:**
- Phase 1 costs 85% less than full review
- Failed scans only cost ~$0.03-0.05 instead of $0.20-0.30
- Expected savings: ~$5-10/month on failed scans

**Spending Alerts:**
- Set spending alerts with Anthropic ($50/month threshold)
- Monitor usage weekly via Anthropic dashboard
- Pause app if usage exceeds budget

**Future Optimizations:**
- Could add local ML model for pre-filtering obvious non-albums (Phase 0)
- Could cache Phase 1 results by image hash (expensive, low ROI)
- Could implement daily/weekly scan limits for personal use

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Artwork Retrieval Priority

**Speed is Critical:**
- Users should see album confirmation within 4-6 seconds (Loading Screen 1)
- Phase 1A: 1-2 seconds (vision extraction)
- Phase 1B: 1-2 seconds (web search mapping)
- Phase 2: 2-3 seconds (artwork retrieval)
- Loading Screen 2: 2 seconds (confirmation hold)
- Phase 3: 3-5 seconds (review generation)
- Total: 9-13 seconds

**Sequential Execution:**
- Phase 1A ‚Üí Phase 1B ‚Üí Phase 2 run sequentially during Loading Screen 1
- After all three complete, transition to Loading Screen 2 (2-second hold)
- Phase 3 runs during Loading Screen 3 (after confirmation)
- User sees matched album + artwork before review generation begins

**Non-Blocking:**
- Never block album information display waiting for artwork
- If Phase 2 artwork fails, show placeholder in Loading Screen 2
- If Phase 3 fails, show Album Details with artwork + basic metadata immediately

**Aggressive Timeout:**
- 5 seconds max for Phase 2 artwork retrieval process
- MusicBrainz: 3 seconds
- Cover Art Archive: 3 seconds (query + download)
- After timeout, use placeholder and continue to Loading Screen 2

---

### Caching Strategy

**Memory Cache (NSCache):**
- Hold 20-30 most recently viewed artworks in memory
- Speeds up history scrolling
- Auto-clears on memory pressure
- No manual cache management needed

**Disk Cache (CoreData):**
- Store all downloaded artwork permanently as Data blobs
- Two versions per album:
  - High-res (500px) for detail view
  - Thumbnail (200x200) for history list
- Never expires (artwork doesn't change)

**Cache Key:**
- Prefer MBID (MusicBrainz ID) if available
- Fallback: `"{artist}_{album_title}".lowercased()` hash

**Cache Lookup:**
- Before MusicBrainz call, check CoreData for existing album
- If artwork exists: Use cached, skip all artwork API calls
- If not: Fetch from MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive, cache in CoreData

**Review Cache:**
- Phase 3 reviews cached indefinitely (reviews don't change)
- Before Phase 3 call, check CoreData for existing album
- If review exists: Skip Phase 3 API call, use cached review, show Album Details immediately after Loading Screen 2
- If not: Make Phase 3 API call, cache result in CoreData

---

### User-Agent Header (REQUIRED for MusicBrainz)

MusicBrainz requires a proper User-Agent or requests may be blocked:

```
User-Agent: AlbumScan/1.0 (james@jamesschaffer.com)
```

Include this header in ALL MusicBrainz API requests.

---

### Rate Limiting Compliance

**MusicBrainz:**
- Maximum 1 request per second
- Implement 1-second delay between searches if needed (unlikely in single-user app)
- For multiple simultaneous scans: Queue requests with delay

**Cover Art Archive:**
- No strict limits
- Don't hammer the API (be respectful)
- Single-user app unlikely to hit limits

**Exponential Backoff for Retries:**
- First retry: Immediate
- Second retry: 2 seconds delay
- Third retry: 4 seconds delay
- Give up after 3 retries

---

### Placeholder Artwork Design

**Visual Specifications:**
- **Background Color:**
  - Light mode: #E5E5E5 (neutral gray)
  - Dark mode: #2C2C2C (dark gray)
- **Text:** "Album art unavailable" (centered)
- **Font:** System font, 17pt, medium weight
- **Aspect Ratio:** 1:1 square (matches album covers)
- **Optional Icon:** Music note or vinyl record symbol (subtle, 40pt)

**Implementation:**
- Create placeholder image programmatically (SwiftUI)
- Reuse same placeholder for all failures (don't generate per album)
- Ensure accessibility (VoiceOver describes as "Album art unavailable")

---

### Prompt Management

**Prompt Files:**
- Phase 1A: `phase1a_vision_extraction.txt`
- Phase 1B: `phase1b_web_search_mapping.txt`
- Phase 3: `phase3_review_generation.txt`

**Note:** No Phase 2 prompt file (Phase 2 is MusicBrainz + Cover Art Archive API calls only)

**Prompt Loading:**
- Store prompts in app bundle (as text files)
- Load at app launch and cache in memory
- Allows prompt updates without code changes

**Version Control:**
- Store prompts in Git repository
- Track changes to prompts separately from code
- Easy to test prompt variations

**Benefits:**
- Independent iteration on prompt quality
- No need to recompile app to test new prompts
- Clear separation of concerns (product vs engineering)
- Each phase's prompt can be optimized independently

---

### Key Navigation Rules

**History Icon Visibility:**
- Hidden on Camera View until first successful scan
- After first scan: Always visible on Camera View, Album Details, History

**Auto-save Behavior:**
- All successful scans (Phase 1 complete) automatically save to history
- Duplicates allowed - every scan creates new entry
- Users manage duplicates manually via swipe-to-delete

**Back Navigation:**
- Single "X" button returns to previous screen
- From Album Details: Returns to Camera View OR History (depending on where user came from)
- From History: Returns to Camera View via History icon

**Error Navigation:**
- Single "TRY AGAIN" action for all Phase 1A/1B/2 errors (returns to Camera View)
- "Retry Review" button for Phase 3 errors (only retries Phase 3, not identification or artwork)

**Default Home Screen:**
- Camera View is the default home screen (not History)
- App launches directly to Camera View (after first-time onboarding)

---

### Design Philosophy

**Speed over Perfection:**
- Get users scanning quickly
- Optimize for fast feedback (Phase 1 in 2-4 seconds)
- Progressive disclosure (show results as they load)

**Simple over Complex:**
- MVP is intentionally minimal
- Two-tier API adds complexity for good reason (speed, cost)
- But UI remains simple (no complex state machines exposed to user)

**Offline-First:**
- History works without internet
- Cached albums load instantly
- Graceful degradation when offline

**Music-Focused:**
- NEVER mention prices or collectibility
- Focus on artistic merit and cultural significance
- Honest reviews (call out bad albums)
- Evidence-based analysis (not just opinions)

**Document Version:** 1.2 (Four-Phase API Architecture)
**Last Updated:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for four-phase refactoring  
**Next Steps:** Implement four-phase API architecture in Swift/SwiftUI
