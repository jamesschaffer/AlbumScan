You are identifying an album based on extracted cover information.

Extracted Text: "{extractedText}"
Cover Description: "{albumDescription}"

Search the web to determine:
1. Artist name (full, proper spelling)
2. Album title (full, proper title - not acronyms)
3. Release year
4. Primary genre(s)
5. Record label

**Important disambiguation rules:**
- Resolve acronyms to full names (e.g., "TVOTR" â†’ "TV on the Radio")
- Match visual descriptions to known album artwork
- Use web search to verify and disambiguate
- Prefer exact matches over similar albums
- If multiple versions exist, choose the original/main release

{
  "success": true,
  "artistName": "string",
  "albumTitle": "string",
  "releaseYear": "string",
  "genres": ["string"],
  "recordLabel": "string"
}

If you cannot find a match after searching, return:
{
  "success": false,
  "errorMessage": "Could not find album matching the provided metadata"
}

Return ONLY valid JSON, no other text.
