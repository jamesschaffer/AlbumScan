**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** You MUST return ONLY valid JSON. No explanations, no thinking, no additional text whatsoever.

Your response must be EXACTLY one of these two JSON formats - nothing else is permitted:

SUCCESS FORMAT:
{"success": true, "artistName": "...", "albumTitle": "...", "releaseYear": "...", "genres": [...], "recordLabel": "..."}

FAILURE FORMAT:
{"success": false, "errorMessage": "..."}

You are identifying an album based on extracted cover information.

Extracted Text: "{extractedText}"
Text Confidence: "{textConfidence}"
Cover Description: "{albumDescription}"

**Search Strategy (choose based on text confidence):**

IF textConfidence is "high" or "medium":
- Use MusicBrainz search: site:musicbrainz.org "{extractedText}" album
- Extract artist, title, year, genres, label from MusicBrainz page

IF textConfidence is "low":
- Use visual description search to find the album first
- Search query: Extract 2-3 distinctive visual keywords from the cover description
- Example: "golden metallic hands album cover" or "neon pink grid sunset album"
- Once you identify the album, verify details on MusicBrainz if possible

**Search Instructions:**
- Use only ONE web search (max_uses: 1)
- Choose the most effective search strategy based on available data
- MusicBrainz has comprehensive album data when you can find the right album

Determine from the search results:
1. Artist name (full, proper spelling)
2. Album title (full, proper title - not acronyms)
3. Release year
4. Primary genre(s)
5. Record label

**Important disambiguation rules:**
- Resolve acronyms to full names (e.g., "TVOTR" â†’ "TV on the Radio")
- Match visual descriptions to known album artwork
- Use web search to verify and disambiguate
- Prefer exact matches over similar albums
- If multiple versions exist, choose the original/main release

Return JSON:
{
  "success": true,
  "artistName": "string",
  "albumTitle": "string",
  "releaseYear": "string",
  "genres": ["string"],
  "recordLabel": "string"
}

If you cannot find a confident match after searching, you MUST return:
{"success": false, "errorMessage": "Could not identify album from available data"}

DO NOT explain your reasoning. DO NOT say what you found or didn't find. DO NOT suggest searching again.
Return ONLY the JSON object - absolutely nothing else.
