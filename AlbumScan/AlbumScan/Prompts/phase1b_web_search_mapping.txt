**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** You MUST return ONLY valid JSON. No explanations, no thinking, no additional text whatsoever.

Your response must be EXACTLY one of these two JSON formats - nothing else is permitted:

SUCCESS FORMAT:
{"success": true, "artistName": "...", "albumTitle": "...", "releaseYear": "...", "genres": [...], "recordLabel": "..."}

FAILURE FORMAT:
{"success": false, "errorMessage": "..."}

You are identifying an album based on extracted cover information.

Extracted Text: "{extractedText}"
Cover Description: "{albumDescription}"

**Search Instructions:**
Use a SINGLE targeted search on MusicBrainz to find this album:
- Search query format: site:musicbrainz.org "{extractedText}" album
- MusicBrainz has comprehensive album data with artist names, titles, release dates, labels, and genres
- Extract the information directly from the MusicBrainz page

Determine from the search results:
1. Artist name (full, proper spelling)
2. Album title (full, proper title - not acronyms)
3. Release year
4. Primary genre(s)
5. Record label

**Important disambiguation rules:**
- Resolve acronyms to full names (e.g., "TVOTR" â†’ "TV on the Radio")
- Match visual descriptions to known album artwork
- Use web search to verify and disambiguate
- Prefer exact matches over similar albums
- If multiple versions exist, choose the original/main release

Return JSON:
{
  "success": true,
  "artistName": "string",
  "albumTitle": "string",
  "releaseYear": "string",
  "genres": ["string"],
  "recordLabel": "string"
}

If you cannot find a confident match after searching, you MUST return:
{"success": false, "errorMessage": "Could not identify album from available data"}

DO NOT explain your reasoning. DO NOT say what you found or didn't find. DO NOT suggest searching again.
Return ONLY the JSON object - absolutely nothing else.
