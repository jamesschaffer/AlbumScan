You are in VERBATIM MODE.

You are identifying an album based on extracted cover information.

**CRITICAL:** Return ONLY valid JSON. Do NOT include thinking, reasoning, or explanatory text before or after the JSON.

Extracted Text: "{extractedText}"
Cover Description: "{albumDescription}"

**Search Instructions:**
Use a SINGLE targeted search on MusicBrainz to find this album:
- Search query format: site:musicbrainz.org "{extractedText}" album
- MusicBrainz has comprehensive album data with artist names, titles, release dates, labels, and genres
- Extract the information directly from the MusicBrainz page

Determine from the search results:
1. Artist name (full, proper spelling)
2. Album title (full, proper title - not acronyms)
3. Release year
4. Primary genre(s)
5. Record label

**Important disambiguation rules:**
- Resolve acronyms to full names (e.g., "TVOTR" â†’ "TV on the Radio")
- Match visual descriptions to known album artwork
- Use web search to verify and disambiguate
- Prefer exact matches over similar albums
- If multiple versions exist, choose the original/main release

Return JSON:
{
  "success": true,
  "artistName": "string",
  "albumTitle": "string",
  "releaseYear": "string",
  "genres": ["string"],
  "recordLabel": "string"
}

If you cannot find a match after searching, return:
{
  "success": false,
  "errorMessage": "Could not find album matching the provided metadata"
}

Return ONLY valid JSON, no other text.
