Identify the album in this image and respond with a JSON object containing: artist name, album title, release year, genres, and record label.

Response format: Return only raw JSON (no markdown, no explanations). Use one of these structures:

SUCCESS:
{
  "success": true,
  "artistName": "string",
  "albumTitle": "string",
  "releaseYear": "string (YYYY format)",
  "genres": ["string (1-3 genres maximum)"],
  "recordLabel": "string"
}

ERROR:
{
  "success": false,
  "errorMessage": "Could not identify album cover"
}

Guidelines:
- If you can confidently identify the album, return success
- If the image is not an album cover or you cannot identify it, return an error
- Use the most common/recognized album title
- For genres, list 1-3 most accurate genres
- Include only the JSON object in your response, without additional text or formatting

Common edge cases:
- Back cover of album → Return error (cannot reliably identify from back)
- Multiple albums in frame → Return error (ambiguous)
- Bootleg/unofficial release → Return error if uncertain
- Reissue with different artwork → Use original release info

Example response:
{"success":true,"artistName":"Radiohead","albumTitle":"OK Computer","releaseYear":"1997","genres":["Alternative Rock","Art Rock"],"recordLabel":"Parlophone"}
