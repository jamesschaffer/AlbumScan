Identify the album in this image.

CRITICAL: You MUST use exactly one of the two JSON structures below. Use the EXACT field names shown (artistName, albumTitle, releaseYear, genres, recordLabel). Do not create your own structure or field names:

SUCCESS:
{
  "success": true,
  "artistName": "string",
  "albumTitle": "string",
  "releaseYear": "string (YYYY format)",
  "genres": ["string (1-3 genres maximum)"],
  "recordLabel": "string"
}

ERROR:
{
  "success": false,
  "errorMessage": "Could not identify album cover"
}

Guidelines:
- If you can confidently identify the album, return value true for the success attribute, otherwise false
- If the image is not an album cover or you cannot identify it, return an error
- Use the most common/recognized album title
- For genres, list 1-3 most accurate genres
- Include only the JSON object in your response, without additional text or formatting

Common edge cases:
- Back cover of album → Return error (cannot reliably identify from back)
- Multiple albums in frame → Return error (ambiguous)
- Bootleg/unofficial release → Return error if uncertain
- Reissue with different artwork → Use original release info

Example response:
{"success":true,"artistName":"Radiohead","albumTitle":"OK Computer","releaseYear":"1997","genres":["Alternative Rock","Art Rock"],"recordLabel":"Parlophone"}
