        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: November 28, 2025</p>

        <div class="important-notice">
            <p><strong>Please read these terms carefully.</strong> AlbumScan is developed and maintained by an independent developer as a side project. By using this app, you acknowledge the inherent limitations of a solo-maintained service and agree to the terms outlined below.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By downloading, installing, or using AlbumScan ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>
        <p>These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and AlbumScan ("we," "us," or "our"). We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after any modifications constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Nature of the Service</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Independent Development</h3>
        <p>AlbumScan is developed and maintained by a single independent developer as a part-time project. This is not a venture-backed company with dedicated engineering, support, or operations teams. You acknowledge that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The App is maintained on a best-effort basis alongside other professional and personal commitments</li>
            <li>Response times to issues, bug fixes, and feature requests may vary</li>
            <li>Development resources are limited and prioritization is at the sole discretion of the developer</li>
            <li>The service may not receive updates or maintenance indefinitely</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Service Description</h3>
        <p>AlbumScan provides AI-powered album identification and review generation for vinyl records and music albums. The service relies on third-party APIs and services including, but not limited to, Anthropic's Claude API, OpenAI API, MusicBrainz, and Cover Art Archive.</p>

        <h2>3. Service Availability and Uptime</h2>

        <h3>3.1 No Uptime Guarantees</h3>
        <p>WE DO NOT GUARANTEE ANY SPECIFIC LEVEL OF SERVICE AVAILABILITY, UPTIME, OR RELIABILITY. The App is provided on an "as available" basis. You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The service may experience downtime without prior notice</li>
            <li>We do not offer Service Level Agreements (SLAs) or uptime commitments</li>
            <li>Maintenance windows may occur at any time without advance notification</li>
            <li>Third-party service outages (API providers, Apple infrastructure) may affect functionality</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Third-Party Dependencies</h3>
        <p>The App relies on third-party services for core functionality. We are not responsible for outages, changes, deprecations, or discontinuations of these services. If a critical third-party service becomes unavailable or economically unviable, we reserve the right to modify or discontinue affected features.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Service Modifications and Discontinuation</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the App or any part of the service at any time, with or without notice, for any reason including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Changes in third-party API pricing or availability</li>
            <li>Economic infeasibility of continued operation</li>
            <li>Personal circumstances affecting the developer's ability to maintain the service</li>
            <li>Technical challenges that cannot be reasonably resolved</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Subscription Tiers</h3>
        <p>AlbumScan offers the following subscription options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Free Tier:</strong> 5 album scans at no cost</li>
            <li><strong>Base Subscription:</strong> Annual subscription providing 120 scans per month with standard identification</li>
            <li><strong>Ultra Subscription:</strong> Annual subscription providing 120 scans per month with advanced search capabilities</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Payment Processing</h3>
        <p>All payments are processed through Apple's App Store. We do not collect, store, or process payment information directly. All billing inquiries, disputes, and payment issues must be directed to Apple.</p>

        <h3>4.3 Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>Due to the nature of digital services and the immediate delivery of value upon subscription activation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No refunds</strong> will be issued for subscription fees once a subscription period has begun</li>
            <li>Refund requests must be directed to Apple through their standard App Store refund process</li>
            <li>We do not have the ability to issue refunds directly as payments are processed by Apple</li>
            <li>Unused scans do not carry over between billing periods and are not refundable</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.4 Service Discontinuation and Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>In the event that we discontinue the service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We will make reasonable efforts to provide advance notice when possible</li>
            <li>Active subscriptions will not be renewed after the discontinuation announcement</li>
            <li>No prorated refunds will be issued for the remaining portion of active subscription periods</li>
            <li>You acknowledge this risk as part of using an independently-maintained service</li>
        </ul>
