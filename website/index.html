            <h2>I built this for myself.</h2>
            <div class="philosophy-content">
                <p>After 10 years of collecting, I got tired of the same routine: standing in a record store, holding an album I half-recognized, googling reviews and losing the rhythm of the dig. Either you burn out and buy a dud, or you spend an hour researching and leave with nothing.</p>
                <p>Building a thoughtful collection on a budget is hard. You can eyeball the sleeve condition, but knowing whether this is the album worth owning? That takes knowledge I didn't always have.</p>
                <p>AlbumScan changed how I dig. Now I scan, set it aside, keep flipping, and read the review when it's ready. I buy with confidence instead of hope.</p>
                <p class="highlight">This is not a price guide.</p>
                <p>I don't need to obsess over pressing variations or chase vinyl as an investment. If it plays clean and sounds good, I'm happy. AlbumScan tells you if the music is worth your time—not what the cardboard is worth to someone else.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What albums can it identify?</summary>
                    <p>Most albums from the last 70+ years. Popular releases identify instantly. For deep cuts and obscure pressings, our Ultra tier uses web search to track them down. If an album exists and has been documented anywhere online, we can usually find it.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Does it work on CDs too?</summary>
                    <p>Yes. Any album cover works—vinyl, CD, cassette, even a poster on a wall if you're feeling adventurous.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Why doesn't it show prices or pressing values?</summary>
                    <p>By design. We built AlbumScan for people who care about the music, not the market. There are already apps for that. We're focused on helping you discover albums worth listening to.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How accurate are the reviews?</summary>
                    <p>Reviews are AI-generated fresh each time, synthesizing critical consensus, chart history, and cultural context. They're not perfect—think of them as a knowledgeable friend giving you their take, not an academic citation. We include a disclaimer because honesty matters.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What's the difference between Base and Ultra?</summary>
                    <p>Base works great for well-known albums—most of what you'll find at a typical record store. Ultra adds advanced web search for identifying obscure releases and provides reviews with cited professional sources (Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, etc.). If you're hunting deep cuts regularly, Ultra pays for itself.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Is my data private?</summary>
                    <p>Your scans stay on your device. We don't have user accounts. We don't track you. We don't sell data. The only thing leaving your phone is the album image going to our AI for identification—and we don't store those.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Why the scan limits and subscription?</summary>
                    <p>AI-powered search isn't cheap to run. Every scan costs real money on the backend—especially Ultra's web search features. The subscription model keeps AlbumScan sustainable so I can maintain it, improve it, and keep it running without taking a loss. I'd rather be upfront about that than shut down in six months.</p>
