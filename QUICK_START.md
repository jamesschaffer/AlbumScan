## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Camera not working
- **Problem**: Camera feed is black or frozen

### API key not found
- **Problem**: "API key not configured" error
- **Solution**: Verify environment variable is set in scheme

### Build errors
- **Problem**: "Cannot find type in scope" errors
- **Solution**: Check file target membership; ensure all files are added to AlbumScan target

### CoreData errors
- **Problem**: CoreData context errors
- **Solution**: Verify `.xcdatamodeld` file is properly added to project

### Album art not showing
- **Problem**: Grey placeholder instead of album art
- **Solution**: Check API response includes `album_art_url`; verify network connection
